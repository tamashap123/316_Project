  "description": "Amendment increases the amount of funds made available to both the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service by $5 million each to help expedite the approval of additional pipeline infrastructure that would more efficiently and cleanly deliver taxpayer-owned resources to consumers and also ensure that the BLM and the Forest Service have the appropriate resources to permit rights-of-way for gathering lines on Federal lands. The increase is offset by a reduction of $12,307,693 (less than one-half of 1 percent to the EPA environmental programs and management accounts).",
