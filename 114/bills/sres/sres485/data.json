Urges such government to demonstrate leadership and commitment to elections by accelerating concrete steps towards holding elections, including registering voters and protecting partisan political speech and activities.\n\nEncourages such government and all other relevant parties to engage in a focused discussion to advance the electoral process and reach consensus on the way forward by establishing a detailed electoral calendar for all elections and enabling the candidate selection and campaign process.\n\nUrges the President of the United States, in close coordination with regional and international partners, to:\n\n continuously verify that such necessary technical dialogue occurs and proceeds in a time and manner required to ensure the conduct of timely elections; use appropriate means to ensure the objectives of this resolution, which may include imposition of additional targeted sanctions on individuals or entities responsible for violence and human rights violations and undermining democratic processes in the DRC; and continue U.S. policy with respect to providing support for the organizing of free, fair, and peaceful national elections."
