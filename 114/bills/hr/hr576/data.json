Requires the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to: (1) aggregate and publicly report information from a collaborative applicant about project sponsors in a community-wide homeless management information system (HMIS), and (2) ensure that any public report does not contain personally identifiable information.\n\nProhibits the Secretary, in awarding grants for continuum of care programs, from considering or prioritizing the specific homeless populations intended to be served by the applicant if the applicant demonstrates that the project: (1) would meet the priorities identified in the applicant's plan, and (2) is cost-effective in meeting the overall goals and objectives identified in that plan.\n\nRepeals certain requirements regarding collaborative applicants.\n\nModifies requirements for selection criteria for the award of grants through a national competition between geographic areas.\n\nRequires annual reports to Congress on housing assistance for the homeless to include data: (1) required to be made publicly available in the HMIS report, and (2) on programs funded under other specified federal statutes."
