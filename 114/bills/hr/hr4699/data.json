Taxpayers whose adjusted gross income exceeds $250,000 in a taxable year are ineligible for such a tax deduction.\n\nThe bill excludes from gross income: (1) distributions from a parental leave savings account that are made not later than one year after the birth or adoption of a child of an account holder, and (2) contributions made by an employer to the parental leave savings account of an employee."
