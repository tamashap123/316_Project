USDA must also take into consideration costs for energy, transportation, and labor.\n\n(The Dairy Margin Protection Program makes payments to participating farmers when actual dairy production margins fall below a farmer-selected insured margin. Average feed costs are part of the formula used to calculate actual dairy production margins.)"
