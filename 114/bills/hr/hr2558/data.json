Authorizes the Board to convene a science panel to consider exposure claims and report results to the Board.\n\nAuthorizes the DOD Secretary to provide to such members and dependents the health care benefits recommended by the Board.\n\nRequires the DOD Secretary to: (1) compile a list of individuals exposed to environmental hazards at the facility during the period in which the air, water, or soil was contaminated; and (2) submit a related report to Congress."
