The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nLali's Law\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit the Department of Health and Human Services to make grants to states that allow standing orders (documents that allow a person to acquire, dispense, or administer a prescription medication without a person-specific prescription) for opioid overdose reversal medication (e.g., naloxone). (Opioids are drugs with effects similar to opium, such as heroin and certain pain medications.)\n\nGrants may be used for:\n\n developing standing orders for opioid overdose reversal medication for pharmacies; encouraging pharmacies to dispense medication pursuant to such a standing order; implementing best practices for prescribing opioids, prescribing opioid overdose reversal medication with opioids, and discussing opioid overdose reversal medication with patients; developing training for prescribers to use in educating the public on administration of opioid overdose reversal medication; and educating the public on the availability and public health benefits of opioid overdose reversal medication. States must report on pharmacies that dispense opioid overdose reversal medication under a standing order and the number of pharmacists trained in educating the public on administration of opioid overdose reversal medication.\n\n(Sec. 3) As an offset, this bill reduces the authorization of appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities."
