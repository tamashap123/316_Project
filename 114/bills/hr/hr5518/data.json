The bill continues to exempt from FMLA coverage employees at worksites that employ fewer than 15 employees (currently 50), if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is fewer than 15 (currently 50).\n\n An employee covered by FMLA may take up to 4 hours during any 30-day period, and up to 24 hours during any 12-month period, of parental involvement leave to: (1) participate in or attend activities that are sponsored by a school or community organization, and (2) relate to a program of the school or organization that is attended by the employee's child or grandchild.\n\n Such parental involvement leave may be used to meet routine family medical care needs, including: (1) such employee's medical and dental appointments, or their spouse, child, or grandchild; and (2) the care needs of their related elderly individuals, including visits to nursing homes and group homes.\n\n An employee may elect, or an employer may require, substitution of any of the employee's paid or family leave or paid medical or sick leave for any leave allowed under this bill.\n\n Nothing in this bill shall require an employer to grant paid sick leave or paid medical leave in situations where the employer would not normally grant it.\n\nThe bill imposes on the employee requesting leave certain notification requirements. An employer may require certification supporting such requests.\n\nThe bill applies the parental involvement and family wellness leave allowance to federal employees."
