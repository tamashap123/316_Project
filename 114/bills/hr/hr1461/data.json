Directs DOT to transfer, on October 1, 2015, all amounts in the Mass Transit Account to the Highway Account.\n\nRepeals:\n\n the transportation alternatives program; the prohibition against approval of federal-aid highway projects or regulatory actions that will result in the severance of an existing major route or have significant adverse impact on the safety for nonmotorized transportation traffic and light motorcycles, unless the project or action provides for a reasonable alternative route or such a route exists; the authorization for states to use certain funds for construction of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities; and the requirement that a state set-aside a specified amount of its apportionment of surface transportation program funds for off-system bridges (those not on a federal-aid highway). Defines \"transportation alternatives\" as any of the following activities when carried out as part of an authorized or funded federal-aid highway program or project, or as an independent program or project related to surface transportation for the construction, planning, and design of: (1) transportation projects to achieve compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; or (2) infrastructure-related projects and systems that will provide safe routes for nondrivers, including children, older adults, and individuals with disabilities to access daily needs.\n\nEliminates the requirement that statewide transportation plans and statewide transportation improvement programs provide for the development of accessible pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities."
