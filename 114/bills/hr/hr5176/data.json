(The transition assistance program is a Labor program that assists members of the armed forces separating from active duty and their spouses in identifying and obtaining employment and training opportunities.)\n\nThe research program shall address:\n\n whether and how employment barriers and employment aspirations facing such veterans are substantively different from other veteran populations; and whether the transition program is designed to address such differences and, if not, changes that could be made to do so."
