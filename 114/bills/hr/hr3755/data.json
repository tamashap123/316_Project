The bill specifies that these limitations shall not apply to any residency position that counts towards meeting the VA's obligation under the Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014 to increase by 1,500 the number of GME residency positions at VA medical facilities.\n\nThe bill also extends by five years the period over which the VA must increase the number of\u00a0GME residency positions at its medical facilities."
