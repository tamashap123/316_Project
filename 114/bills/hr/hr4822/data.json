The Secretary shall\u00a0develop model reporting statements and create and maintain a public website, with searchable capabilities, for purposes of posting pension plan information required by this Act.\n\nThe bill grants the United States an exemption\u00a0from liability for any current or future shortfall in any state or local government employee pension plan."
