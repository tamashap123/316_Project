For a qualifying child to be taken into account for the EITC, a tax return must include a certification of the child's residency.\n\nThe bill prohibits the refundable portion of the child tax credit (commonly referred to as the additional child tax credit) from being claimed for a qualifying child unless the tax return includes a valid social security number for the child.\n\nThe bill increases from two to five years the disallowance period for taxpayers who improperly claim the EITC due to reckless or intentional disregard of rules and regulations."
