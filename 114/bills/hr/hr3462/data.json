The bill also revises amounts allocated from the Fund to various programs, including amounts for programs concerning: (1) coastal wetlands, (2) boating safety, and (3) boating infrastructure. A separate amount is set aside each fiscal year through FY2020 for the Coast Guard's administration of the national recreational boating safety program.\n\nWhen the President submits a budget for FY2017 and each fiscal year thereafter, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service must submit an assessment of the administrative services it provides under the Act to states and the sportfishing community."
