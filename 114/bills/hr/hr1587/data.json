(Thus, allows the \"unlocking\" of mobile devices without requiring an owner to obtain the consent of the initial carrier network before switching to a new carrier.)\n\nDirects the President to ensure that applicable bilateral and multilateral trade agreements are modified to be consistent with this Act."
