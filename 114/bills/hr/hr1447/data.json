Perkins Career and Technical Education Act of 2006 to revise its purposes, which are to develop more fully the academic and career and technical skills of secondary education students and postsecondary students who elect to enroll in career and technical education programs (as under current law), by:\n\n preparing those students for employment in current or emerging in-demand industry sectors or occupations; aligning the skills, certifications, and credentials of the students with those needed by employers in the labor markets served by educational institutions; and ensuring that the selection of skills, certifications, and credentials acquired by such students is guided by timely labor market information. An \"in-demand industry sector or occupation\" is:\n\n an industry sector that has a substantial current or potential impact on the state, regional, or local economy, and that contributes to the growth or stability of other supporting businesses, or the growth of other industry sectors; or an occupation that currently has or is projected to have a number of positions in an industry sector so as to have a significant impact on the state, regional, or local economy."
