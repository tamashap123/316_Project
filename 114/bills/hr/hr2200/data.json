The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nCBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015\n\n (Sec. 2) Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to direct the Office of Intelligence and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) support homeland security-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their claims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, public health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support homeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such homeland security hazards, including the transportation of chemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological materials, by providing relevant quantitative and nonquantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security intelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, protection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information and provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, local, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and biodefense stakeholders and other federal agencies, as appropriate.\n\nRequires the Office to coordinate with other DHS components, the Intelligence Community, and federal, state, local, and tribal authorities, including officials from high-threat areas, state and major urban area fusion centers, and local public health departments where appropriate, and enable such entities to provide recommendations on optimal information sharing mechanisms and on how they can provide information to DHS.\n\nDirects DHS to report annually on: (1) intelligence and information sharing activities to counter the threat from attacks using chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, and (2) DHS's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies. Terminates this reporting requirement after the end of the five-year period beginning on this Act's enactment.\n\n(Sec. 3) Requires DHS to ensure that homeland security information analyzed by it concerning terrorist threats is provided to state, local, tribal, and private entities and the public."
