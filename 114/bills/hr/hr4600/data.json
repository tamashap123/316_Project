The bill permits posthumous benefits under specified circumstances.\n\n With respect to a removal proceeding under INA:\n\n a notice to appear shall not be issued against an alien who serves or has served under honorable conditions in the Armed Forces without prior DHS approval; DHS, in determining whether to issue a notice, shall consider the alien's eligibility for naturalization, military service record, grounds of deportability, and any hardship to the Armed Forces, the alien, and his or her family if the alien were to be placed in removal proceedings; and an alien who serves or has served under honorable conditions in the Armed Forces shall not be removed from the United States on specified grounds."
