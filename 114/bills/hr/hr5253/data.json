Such employees shall, in addition to other duties, screen admissions applications against federal criminal, national security, and terrorism databases.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall:\n\n establish within U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a visa security advisory opinion unit to respond to State Department requests for visa security reviews; and provide, in a risk-based manner, for remote pre-adjudicated visa security assistance at posts that are not assigned such employees. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) shall:\n\n screen electronic passports at U.S. entry airports by reading each passport's embedded chip, and utilize facial recognition or other biometric technology to screen travelers at such airports. Electronic passport screening shall apply to U.S. citizens, nationals of a visa waiver program country, and nationals of any other foreign country that issues electronic passports.\n\nFacial recognition or other biometric technology shall apply to nationals of a visa waiver program country.\n\nThe CBP shall, in a risk-based manner, continuously screen individuals issued any visa and individuals who are visa waiver program nationals against criminal, national security, and terrorism databases.\n\nThe annual visa overstay report is revised.\n\nDHS shall ensure that certain foreign student information is available at each U.S. port of entry to CBP officers who inspect aliens seeking U.S. admission."
