In enforcement actions, the FTC must prove a violation of FTC-enforced law.\n\nThe FTC must report annually regarding its: (1) commenced, concluded, and closed investigations; (2) projected activities and timelines for the next year; and (3) enforcement actions to address unfair or deceptive acts or practices that may have targeted or significantly affected individuals 65 or older."
