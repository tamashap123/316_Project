Loans under the program are not eligible for the federal public service loan forgiveness program.\n\nED must provide through the Internet a tool to enable borrowers to make payments and access specified details regarding loans.\n\nThe bill amends the Social Security Act (SSAct) to provide ED with access to information in the National Directory of New Hires to determine when borrowers are hired and remind them of their repayment status and obligation to provide accurate employment information.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require: (1) reporting on W-2 forms the total amount deducted and withheld under the IDEA Loan Repayment Program, and (2) the Department of the Treasury to disclose to ED tax return information necessary to carry out the IDEA Loan Repayment Program."
