Specifically, it limits drug offense convictions that bar a student from participating in federal student aid programs.\n\nUnder current law, any drug offense conviction involving sale or possession of a controlled substance triggers suspension of federal student aid eligibility for a student who commits the drug offense while enrolled in postsecondary education and receiving federal student aid. This bill excludes from triggering drug offense convictions any misdemeanor offense for marijuana possession that occurred before, on, or after enactment of this bill.\n\nThis bill reestablishes federal student aid eligibility for certain students who are ineligible\u00a0due to a prior conviction for misdemeanor marijuana possession."
