Benefits shall include diagnostic services, preventative services, endodontics and other restorative services, surgical services, and emergency services.\n\nEnrollment shall be voluntary. The VA shall: (1) prescribe the minimum enrollment period, and (2) prescribe and annually adjust the premiums necessary to cover costs associated with carrying out the plan. Each individual covered by the plan shall pay the entire premium and the full cost of any copayments.\n\nThe VA shall permit voluntary disenrollment within 30 days after initial enrollment and under other specified circumstances the VA shall prescribe to the extent that such disenrollment does not jeopardize the fiscal integrity of the plan.\n\nThis bill's provisions terminate on December 31, 2021."
