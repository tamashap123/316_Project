The project must test the extent to which these incentives: (1) improve early detection and treatment of diabetes-related vision problems, (2) reduce the cost of Medicare services, and (3) achieve beneficiary satisfaction.\n\nThe project\u00a0shall identify for participation at least 100 primary care practices in at least 10 states that have high per capita costs of diabetes care for Medicare beneficiaries.\n\nProject costs shall be paid from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund."
