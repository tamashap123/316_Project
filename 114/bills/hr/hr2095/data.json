Places a three-year limit on immigration-related misrepresentations rendering aliens inadmissible. Revises the definition \"conviction\" for INA purposes.\n\nAuthorizes an immigration judge in specified circumstances, including family separation hardship, but with certain exceptions, to decline to order an alien removed, deported, or excluded and terminate related proceedings or grant permission to reapply for admission or for relief from removal."
