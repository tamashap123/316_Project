The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\n(Sec. 1) This bill amends the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to permit candidates for election to federal office to: (1) designate an individual for each of a candidate's authorized campaign committees who will be authorized to disburse funds of the committee in the event of the candidate's death, and (2) designate another individual to carry out the responsibilities of the designated individual in the event of the death or incapacity of the designated individual or the designated individual's unwillingness to carry out the responsibilities.\n\nThe bill prescribes procedures for filing and revoking such a designation, and permits the filing of a designation to contain the candidate's instructions regarding the disbursement of funds."
