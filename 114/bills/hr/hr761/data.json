Requires such plan to: (1) include a weed management component, (2) include a native fish passage and habitat quality improvement component, and (3) include a component that deals with public safety and environmental clean-up issues associated with illegal marijuana production.\n\nPermits grazing in the Conservation Area: (1) to continue, if established before this Act's enactment; (2) if not established before enactment, only to the extent that it is consistent with the purposes for which the Monument was established; or (3) through issuing annual targeted permits for the control of noxious weeds, fire suppression, or to provide other ecological benefits.\n\nEstablishes the Berryessa Snow Mountain National Monument Advisory Council to advise with respect to the preparation and implementation of the management plan for the Monument. Requires the appointment of one Council member to represent Native American tribes."
