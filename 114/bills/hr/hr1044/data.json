    "text": "This bill amends the Clean Air Act to modify provisions regarding geographical areas that do not attain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for ozone and carbon monoxide. Currently, if an ozone or carbon monoxide nonattainment area is classified as a serious, severe, or extreme area, the nonattainment area's boundaries must be revised to include the entire metropolitan statistical area or consolidated metropolitan statistical area. This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to require each state to revise the boundaries of all of these nonattainment areas that expanded to include the entire statistical area. States must exclude from the nonattainment area all counties within each statistical area that are not in violation of the NAAQS concerned, as determined by air quality monitoring and not by computer modeling."
