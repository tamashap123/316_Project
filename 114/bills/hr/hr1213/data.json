The expanded summary of the House passed version is repeated here.)\n\nOffice of Compliance Administrative and Technical Corrections Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) to revise its procedures for mediation and hearings.\n\nThe Executive Director of the Office of Compliance is required to:\n\n develop a master list of individuals experienced in adjudicating, arbitrating, or mediating the kinds of personnel and other matters for which mediation may be held, including, but not limited to, members of a state or District of Columbia bar and retired judges of U.S. courts; and appoint individuals (mediators) from this list. Currently, mediators are appointed after the Executive Director considers recommendations by certain organizations. Between 30 to 90 days after the end of the mediation period, a CAA-covered legislative branch employee must elect either to file a complaint with the Office or to file a civil action in the proper U.S. district court.\n\nThe Executive Director must also notify all persons participating in a mediation, hearing, or deliberation of the confidentiality requirements and of the sanctions applicable to any person who violates them.\n\n(Sec. 3) Any individual serving as a member of the Board of Directors of the Office as of February 28, 2015, may be appointed to serve for one additional two-year term."
