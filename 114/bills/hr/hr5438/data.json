A person that violates the FCPA's anti-bribery provisions shall be liable for up to treble damages to a securities issuer, domestic business concern, or U.S. person damaged by the violation.\n\nA plaintiff must prove an FCPA anti-bribery violation by the defendant that: (1) prevented the plaintiff from obtaining or retaining business, and (2) assisted the defendant in obtaining or retaining such business."
