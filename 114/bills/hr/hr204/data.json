Expresses the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should redesignate North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\nFinds that the United States did not grant diplomatic recognition to North Korea upon its establishment as a client regime of the former Soviet Union in 1948.\n\nContinues diplomatic nonrecognition of North Korea until such benchmarks have been met.\n\nDirects the President, given North Korea's third nuclear weapons test on February 12, 2013, in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1695, 1718, 1874, and 2087 to instruct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use U.S. influence to secure adoption of a Security Council resolution condemning North Korea's action as a violation of such Resolutions and requiring implementation of comprehensive sanctions and an inspection regime against North Korea."
