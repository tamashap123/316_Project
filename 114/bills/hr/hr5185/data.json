In lieu of the disclosure, the organization may include a statement indicating that no officer, director, trustee, or highly compensated employee of the organization (or individual with similar powers and responsibilities) meets the criteria described above.\n\nTax-exempt organizations must also include either the required disclosure or the statement in annual tax returns filed after the enactment of this bill."
