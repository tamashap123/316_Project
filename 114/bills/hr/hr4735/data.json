The Fund shall consist of, among other things, appropriations as well as:\n\n the reasonable value of stocks of supplies, equipment, and other assets and inventories on order that the AOC transfers to the Fund, minus related liabilities and unpaid obligations; receipts from the sale or exchange of property held in the Fund; all miscellaneous receipts compensating the AOC for loss or damage to any government property under its jurisdiction or care, including the U.S. Botanic Garden; and reimbursements and transfers from certain other accounts. The Fund shall be reimbursed from available AOC accounts for supplies, materials, services, and related expenses, at rates which will approximate the full cost of operations, including:\n\n accrual of employee leave and benefits; depreciation of plant, property, and equipment; and overhead. The AOC may use certain appropriations for the purchase or rental, maintenance, and operation of passenger motor vehicles to provide shuttle service for Members and employees of Congress to and from the House Office Buildings.\n\nAvailable balances of expired AOC appropriations shall be available to the AOC for reimbursing the Department of Labor for any unemployment compensation payments for former AOC employees, without regard to the fiscal year for which the obligation to make such payments is incurred."
