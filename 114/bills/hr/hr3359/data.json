To qualify, a borrower must be a full-time teacher in a low-income school or location and meet other requirements. ED, on behalf of a qualified borrower, makes $250-$400 direct monthly payments on Federal Family Education Loan or Direct Loan program Subsidized, Unsubsidized, and, in certain circumstances, Consolidation Loans.\n\nTo remain eligible for loan repayment, a borrower must continue to be employed in the school or location of initial eligibility.\n\n The total maximum loan repayment amount is $23,400 over six years. A borrower must repay the remaining principal and interest.\n\nAn individual who currently participates in the Teacher Loan Forgiveness program may continue participating in such program or enter the new loan repayment for teachers program."
