Certain funds may be released to replenish that trust fund, however, if the United States and Palau have arranged to advance funds during FY2015 from the trust fund for specified allowable purposes.\n\n The bill authorizes appropriations to: (1) subsidize postal services to Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia for FY2016-FY2024; and (2) carry out specified federal responsibilities under the Compact.\n\nThe bill also repeals specified offset requirements.\n\n FY2016 funding is provided to reduce government arrears of Palau.\n\n FY2016-FY2023 additional economic assistance, and FY2016 funding for infrastructure projects, are provided.\n\nSpecified passport requirements are revised."
