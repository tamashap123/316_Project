    "text": "This bill prohibits individuals operating in the peer-to-peer economy from being considered employees subject to the requirements and restrictions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the National Labor Relations Act if they:\n\n are permitted to determine the hours during which they offer services to users, are subject to a quality-of-service evaluation of the services they furnish through a user-based rating system, furnish any service user with an electronic description of the transaction and the amount paid for it, and use their own tools or assets to furnish those services. The bill defines \"peer-to-peer economy\" as the business of facilitating transactions between a user seeking a service and an individual furnishing the service using an online platform or software application running on a mobile device."
