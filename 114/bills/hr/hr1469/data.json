Currently, this research plan is developed and updated by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nThe NCMRR must: (1) annually report on progress in achieving the objectives, benchmarks, and guiding principles described in the research plan; and (2) develop guidelines governing the funding for medical rehabilitation research by the National Institutes of Health.\n\nThe Medical Rehabilitation Coordinating Committee must periodically host a scientific conference or workshop on medical rehabilitation research.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must enter into interagency agreements to coordinate medical rehabilitation research."
