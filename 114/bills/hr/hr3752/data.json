Loans under the program are not eligible for the federal public service loan forgiveness program.\n\nThe bill amends the Social Security Act (SSAct) to require ED and the Department of Health and Human Services to exchange information necessary to use the National Directory of New Hires to assist in the collection of student loans.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to require the Department of the Treasury to disclose to ED tax return information necessary to carry out the IDEA Loan Repayment Program."
