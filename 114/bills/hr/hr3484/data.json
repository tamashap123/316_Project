The VA shall not enter into any land-sharing agreements unless the agreements provide additional health care resources and benefit veterans and their families in ways other than generating additional revenue.\n\nAny funds received by the VA from a lease shall be credited to the applicable VA medical facilities account and shall be available, without fiscal year limitation and without further appropriation, exclusively for campus renovation and maintenance.\n\nThe VA may, notwithstanding any other provision of law other than federal laws relating to environmental and historic preservation, grant easements or rights-of-way on, above, or under campus lands to:\n\n any local or regional public transportation authority to construct, operate, or maintain public mass transit facilities; and California, Los Angeles county or city, or any agency or political subdivision thereof or any public utility company to provide public utilities. The VA may not sell or convey to a third party fee simple title to any real property or related improvements made at the campus.\n\nThe VA shall ensure that each lease carried is consistent with the draft master plan approved by the VA on January 28, 2016, or successor master plans.\n\nThe VA shall establish a Community Veterans Engagement Board to coordinate locally with the VA to: (1) identify community goals; and (2) provide advice to improve services for veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their families."
