But it shall not be considered discrimination for a gas station or convenience store with one attendant on duty to fail to provide such requested gas pumping assistance if such attendant notifies the individual that assistance cannot be provided because there is only one attendant on duty.\n\nThe Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice must: (1) promulgate regulations necessary to ensure compliance with this Act, and (2) make graphics for the decals publicly available on their websites."
