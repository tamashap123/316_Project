The Passport Act of 1926 is amended to:\n\n prohibit the Secretary of State from issuing a passport or passport card to an individual who is a member, or attempting to become a member, of a foreign terrorist organization; and direct the Secretary to revoke a passport or passport card previously issued to any such individual. A person who is denied issuance of a passport or passport card or whose passport or passport card is revoked or otherwise restricted may request a due process hearing not later than 60 days after receiving notice of the nonissuance, revocation, or restriction."
