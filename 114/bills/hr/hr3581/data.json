Funding levels for FY2025 and beyond must equal the greater of a specified amount or 40% of the amount determined using this formula.\n\nWith respect to school improvement programs under ESEA, the bill establishes funding levels for each year from FY2016-FY2025 in amounts equal to the difference between: (1) the amount appropriated for the programs in FY2015, and (2) the greater of a specified amount for the applicable fiscal year or the full amount authorized to be appropriated for that fiscal year for such programs.\n\nAmounts appropriated under the bill must be expended in a manner consistent with pay-as-you-go requirements."
