If a signatory appoints an individual who does not meet such qualifications, it shall provide the Board with an explanation of the individual's qualifications and why such qualifications will be beneficial to the Board.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) shall ensure that the next three federal appointments to the Board and an absolute majority thereafter have such qualifications and include appointees who reflect the diversity of the communities in the region served. If DOT appoints an individual who does not meet such qualifications, it shall provide the Board with an explanation."
