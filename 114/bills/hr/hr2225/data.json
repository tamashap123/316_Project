The dividends received are subject to an effective tax rate of 5.25% when repatriated in the United States.\n\nThe bill divides tax revenues attributable to such repatriated earnings equally for: (1) federal debt reduction, (2) transfers to the Highway Trust Fund, and (3) adjustments to limitations on defense discretionary spending."
