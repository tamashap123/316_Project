    "text": "Qualifying Renewable Chemical Production or Investment Tax Credit Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for the production of renewable chemicals. The bill defines \"renewable chemical\" as any chemical that: (1) is produced in the United States from renewable biomass; (2) is sold or used for the production of chemical products, polymers, plastics, or formulated products or as chemicals, polymers, plastics, or formulated products; (3) has a biobased content of 95% or higher; (4) is the product of, or reliant upon, biological or thermal conversion of renewable biomass; (5) is not sold or used for the production of any food, feed, or fuel; and (6) is not a combination of certain specified renewable chemicals.\n\nThe bill also allows a tax credit for investment in renewable chemical production facilities.\n\nThe bill requires the Department of Agriculture to establish a program to allocate renewable chemical tax credit amounts to eligible taxpayers and imposes an aggregate limit on the amount of credits that may be allocated to not more than $500 million during the 5-year period after enactment of this Act."
