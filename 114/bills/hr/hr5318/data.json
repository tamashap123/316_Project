The FTC's enforcement actions or consent orders may not be based solely on allegations that acts or practices are inconsistent with guidelines or general policy statements unless the acts or practices violate FTC-enforced law.\n\nCompliance with guidelines or general statements of policy may be used as evidence of compliance with a law under which the guidelines or statements were issued."
