The selected projects may be ones for which:\n\n Congress has appropriated partial funding or the VA has identified a need for the project by listing it on the Major Construction Strategic Capital Investment Planning priority list, and a non-federal entity has entered or is willing to enter into a formal agreement with the VA to independently finance and/or donate acceptable project funds at no additional government cost. One of the non-federal entity partnership agreements shall be a project to design, finance, and construct a new ambulatory care center in Omaha, Nebraska."
