(Currently, such plans only pay qualified higher education expenses.) Included as qualified elementary and secondary education expenses are expenses for tuition, fees, academic tutoring, special needs services, books, supplies, and computer technology or equipment.\n\nThe bill also increases from $2,000 to $15, 000 the limit on the amount that may be contributed to a tax-exempt Coverdell education savings account. The new contribution limit is adjusted for inflation in each taxable year beginning after 2015."
