A ban is imposed on dealing in government finance and restrictions on U.S. business operations on a person that engages in such activity.\n\n The President may waive the application of sanctions under specified circumstances.\n\nThe Department of Justice may bring an action in U.S. district court for injunctive and other relief with respect to such activities.\n\nProcurement and export sanctions are imposed on any U.S. person that transfers goods or technology, enters into contracts, or engages in trade with Rosoboronexport.\n\nThe bill directs the Secretary of Defense (DOD) to report to Congress regarding: (1) transfers of lethal military equipment by Rosoboronexport to separatist groups in Ukraine and to the government of Syria; and (2) contracts, memorandums of understanding, cooperative agreements, grants, and loans and loan guarantees between DOD and Rosoboronexport."
