The TSA may extend for one year implementation of the requirement for passengers who have been designated frequent fliers.\n\nThe TSA may provide access to expedited airport security screening to additional passengers through an alternate method upon submission to Congress of an independent assessment of its security effectiveness.\n\n(Sec. 4) The TSA shall report annually to Congress certain information on passengers provided expedited security screening."
