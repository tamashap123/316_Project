An employer shall be considered to have committed an unlawful act if the employer requires an employee to sign a contract or waiver that would prohibit the employee from disclosing information about the employee's wages.\n\nCivil penalties are established for violation of prohibitions against sex discrimination.\n\nThe Department of Labor, together with the Department of Education, shall conduct a multistate study, through a grant to a nonprofit research institution, that includes strategies to increase the participation of women in high-wage, high-demand occupations and industries in which women are underrepresented.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall also conduct a multistate study to develop such strategies."
