Requires any proceeds from the conveyance of such land by either county to be considered windfall profits that shall revert to the United States.\n\n Instructs Escambia County and Santa Rosa County to preserve those areas of the land conveyed under this Act that, as of the enactment of this Act, are dedicated for conservation, preservation, public recreation access, and public parking."
