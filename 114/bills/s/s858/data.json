    "text": "Energy Savings Through Public-Private Partnerships Act of 2015\n\n\n\nThis bill amends the National Energy Conservation Policy Act to revise requirements for energy savings performance and utility energy service contracts (performance contracts). (These contracts allow federal agencies to work with private contractors on energy efficiency upgrades to federal facilities.)\n\nEach federal facility energy manager must provide an explanation regarding life cycle cost-effective measures that have not been implemented as part of the web-based compliance certification system. (Life cycle costs are the total cost of owning, operating, and maintaining a building over its useful life.)\n\nThe Department of Energy must report to the President and Congress on each agency's performance contracts, including their investment value and their energy savings.\n\nThe energy conservation measures that may be contained in performance contracts are expanded by including those involving energy consuming devices and required support structures.\n\nAgencies may not limit recognition of operation and maintenance savings associated with energy systems that were modernized or replaced with energy conservation measures and water conservation measures (e.g. lower energy and water bills due to energy efficiency and conservation measures).\n\nAgencies may sell or transfer energy savings and apply the proceeds to fund a performance contract.\n\nThe energy savings that may be contained in performance contracts are expanded to include: (1) the use, sale, or transfer of energy incentives, rebates, or credits (including renewable energy credits) from governments or utilities; and (2) any revenue generated from a reduction in energy or water use, more efficient waste recycling, or additional energy generated from more efficient equipment."
