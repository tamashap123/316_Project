Requires USDA, before awarding a contract funded by the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund, to determine whether the contractor has the ability to complete the proposed restoration activities, including:\n\n the financial ability to raise the funds necessary, and sufficient capacity to perform the type and scope of those activities. Reauthorizes the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Fund for each of FY2016-FY2024."
