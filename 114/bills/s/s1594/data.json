    "text": "Arm All Pilots Act of 2015\n\nThis bill revises requirements for the federal flight deck officer program.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shall designate additional training facilities for:\n\n firearms training and recurrent training for federal flight deck officers, and initial firearm training and certification of pilots seeking to be deputized as federal flight deck officers. DHS (formerly, the Under Secretary of Transportation for Security of the Department of Transportation) shall:\n\n require officers, but no less than once every six months, to requalify to carry firearms on domestic flights; and permit officers to requalify at certified private or government-owned gun ranges. DHS may require certain limitations on initial and recurrent training for such officers.\n\nThe bill revises the authority of federal flight deck officers to carry firearms on domestic and foreign flights.\n\nDHS may not establish medical or physical standards for a pilot to become a federal flight deck officer inconsistent with or more stringent than Federal Aviation Administration requirements for issuance of a first- or second-class airman medical certificate.\n\nA pilot deputized as a federal flight deck officer may move from inactive to active status after completing one recurrent training program.\n\nDHS shall allow officers to be screened through the Transportation Security Administration's Known Crew Member program when entering an airport sterile area.\n\nEach air carrier certifying to DHS that it has a pilot deputized as a federal flight deck officer on all its flights shall receive a refund of up to 10% of security service fees collected from passengers on flights operated by that air carrier.\n\nDHS shall revise certain federal regulations to classify information about deputized pilots as sensitive security information."
