    "text": "Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians Water Rights Settlement Act\n\nAuthorizes, ratifies, and confirms the Pechanga Settlement Agreement, entered into by the Pechanga Band of Luiseno Mission Indians, the Rancho California Water District (RCWD), and the United States, except to the extent that it is modified by or conflicts with this Act.\n\nConfirms a Tribal Water Right that must be held in trust by the United States on behalf of the Band and its allottees. (Allottees are individuals who hold a beneficial real property interest in an Indian allotment that is located within the reservation and held in trust by the United States.)\n\nAuthorizes allottees to lease their lands together with any water right.\n\nRequires the Band to enact a Pechanga Water Code that governs the storage, recovery, and use of the Tribal Water Right, subject to the Department of the Interior's approval.\n\nDirects the Band and the United States (acting as trustee for the Band and allottees), to waive all claims for water rights within the Santa Margarita River Watershed.\n\nStates that the Band and the United States (acting as trustee for the Band), waive specified claims against the RCWD.\n\nAuthorizes the waiver of claims by the Band against the United States regarding specified water rights and damages.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Pechanga Settlement Fund.\n\n Makes this Act enforceable on the date Interior publishes specified findings regarding despoits and approved agreements. Repeals this Act and voids any related agreements on May 1, 2021, or an alternative later date agreed to by the Band and Interior, if Interior does not publish those findings.\n\nProhibits Interior from being liable for failing to carry out any obligation or activity under this Act if there are insufficient appropriations."
