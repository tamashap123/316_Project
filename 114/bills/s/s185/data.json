Prohibits the FDA from denying approval of a drug based on a lack of evidence of a favorable benefit-risk profile in a broader population.\n\nDirects the FDA to require: (1) the labeling of a limited population antibacterial drug to indicate that the drug has been approved for use only in a limited population, and (2) submission of promotional materials related to the drug prior to dissemination.\n\nDirects the FDA to describe considerations for demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of these antibacterial drugs and how the limited population pathway can be expanded to other therapeutic areas.\n\nRequires the FDA to conduct post-approval monitoring programs to study how these antibacterial drugs are used and to monitor changes in bacterial drug resistance.\n\nAllows the FDA to remove the labeling, marketing, and post-approval monitoring requirements of these drugs if they are approved for broader use.\n\nAllows the limited population pathway to be expanded to other drugs intended to treat serious illness beginning October 1, 2016."
