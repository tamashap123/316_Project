    "text": "Countering Online Recruitment of Violent Extremists Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require that the criteria for the designation of colleges or universities as a center for homeland security include demonstrated expertise in countering violent extremism (CVE). CVE is defined as proactive and relevant actions to counter efforts by extremists to radicalize, recruit, and mobilize followers to violence and to address the conditions that allow for violent extremist recruitment and radicalization.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is authorized to: (1) establish one or more CVE Labs where students will develop and test technology-based CVE solutions, and (2) reprioritize grants to centers for homeland security to fund each Lab.\n\nAn institution of higher education at which a CVE Lab is established shall ensure that the Lab's faculty:\n\n creates a curriculum for participating students to develop and test CVE solutions, that shall include a CVE orientation program during which federal officials shall brief students on precautions to protect themselves from becoming a target of terrorists; supervises any deployment of a technology-based CVE solution by a student; develops a framework for participation and support of other programs that encourages peer-to-peer CVE solutions; develops a common inventory of research, in conjunction with other centers that establish CVE Labs, on core CVE issues to inform CVE Lab curricula; analyzes social networks to identify individuals on social media who are susceptible to recruitment to violent extremism and indicators of susceptibility; and identifies experts who can apply CVE solutions to target susceptible individuals. The bill requires institutions to report on, and DHS to commission an independent third-party assessment of, the impact of each Lab. The bill sunsets seven years after enactment."
