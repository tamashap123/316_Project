Equity in Government Compensation Act of 2015 (Sec. 3) This bill requires the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency to suspend the compensation packages approved for 2015 for the chief executive officers of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (government sponsored enterprises or GSEs), and any affiliates, and in lieu of such packages establish the compensation and benefits for each such chief executive officer at the same level in effect for that officer as of January 1, 2015. Such compensation and benefits may not thereafter be increased.\n\nThis suspension shall not be construed to affect the prohibition of the STOCK Act against receipt of bonuses by the chief executive officer of each GSE during any period of conservatorship. It shall only apply to such a chief executive officer if the GSE is in conservatorship or receivership as a critically undercapitalized regulated entity pursuant to the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992.\n\n(Sec. 4) Any chief executive officer affected by this compensation package suspension shall not be considered a federal employee."
