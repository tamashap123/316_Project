However, a state plan may establish an alternative payment methodology that: (1) is agreed to by the state and the grantee, and (2) results in payment to the grantee that at least equals the amount otherwise required to be paid to the grantee under the bill.\n\nAs a condition of receiving payment under the bill, a grantee shall be subject to specified quality management and reporting requirements."
