Such an entity may not claim a tax deduction for interest that exceeds 25% of its adjusted taxable income and may not carry\u00a0forward interest which is paid or accrued during the first year in which such entity becomes an applicable entity.\n\nThe bill requires an applicable entity to file an annual application for an approval agreement (i.e., a prefiling, advance pricing, or other agreement involving a related-party transaction) with the Internal Revenue Service during the 10-year period after it becomes an applicable entity."
