    "text": "Bailout Prevention Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Reserve Act, with respect to the discounting of obligations arising out of actual commercial transactions, to declare a borrower ineligible to borrow from any emergency lending program or facility unless the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and all federal banking regulators with jurisdiction over the borrower certify that, at the time the borrower initially borrows under the program or facility, the borrower is not insolvent.\n\nA borrower shall be deemed insolvent for such purposes if it is a bridge financial company (organized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] to resolve a covered financial company) or a bridge depository institution (a new national bank or federal savings association organized by the FDIC to assume the deposits of one or more insured depository institutions that are in default or in danger of default).\n\n The annual (penalty) interest rate for emergency lending must be at least 500 basis points greater than the cost of borrowing for the United States Treasury for a commensurate loan term.\n\nThe Board may create an emergency lending program or facility that does not meet the broad-based eligibility requirement (that at least five companies be eligible to participate in it) or this penalty rate requirement, but only if Congress enacts a joint resolution of approval within 30 days.\n\nThe Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 is amended to repeal the authorization for certain financial holding companies to engage in, or own or control shares of a company that is engaged in commodity trading, selling, or investing if certain requirements are met."
