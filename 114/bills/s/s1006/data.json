DOT shall:\n\n study the effectiveness of positive train control and related technologies on reducing collisions at highway-rail grade crossings; and promulgate regulations to require that on-track safety programs, whenever practicable and consistent with other safety requirements and operational considerations, include requiring implementation of redundant signal protection, such as shunting, for maintenance-of-way work crews who depend on a train dispatcher to provide signal protection."
