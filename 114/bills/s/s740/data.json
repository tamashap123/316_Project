Requires the committee to prepare a strategic plan for the implementation of the infrastructure consistent with national security, national defense, national intelligence, and emergency preparedness program policies regarding data accessibility.\n\nRequires the committee to operate GeoPlatform, an electronic service that provides access to geospatial data and metadata for geospatial data.\n\nDirects agencies whose functions involve geospatial data to implement a strategy for advancing geographic information and related geospatial data activities appropriate to that agency's mission in support of the strategic plan for the infrastructure. Requires such agencies to disclose each contract, cooperative agreement, grant, or other transaction that deals with geospatial data.\n\nProhibits, four years after enactment of this Act, federal funding from being made available for the collection, production, acquisition, maintenance, or dissemination of geospatial data that does not comply with applicable standards established by the committee."
