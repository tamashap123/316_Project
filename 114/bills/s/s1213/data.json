A state regulatory authority must also consider:\n\n designation, through a competitive process, of a regulated utility, other party, or a combination of regulated utilities and other parties to be a smart grid coordinator or distribution system operator for the state; and nontransmission alternatives when a regulated utility proposes transmission projects."
