The NCCIC's\u00a0privacy and civil liberties training must include:\u00a0(1) reasonable limits on the receipt, retention, use, and disclosure of information associated with specific persons that is not necessary for cybersecurity purposes; (2) data integrity standards requiring the prompt removal and destruction of obsolete or erroneous names and personal information that is unrelated to the risk or incident information; (3) safeguards and confidentiality protections for\u00a0cyber threat indicators and defensive measures, including information that is proprietary or business-sensitive that may be used to identify specific persons from unauthorized access or acquisition; and (4) methods to ensure that information obtained from efforts to address cybersecurity risks and incidents is used only for such purposes or as specifically authorized by law."
