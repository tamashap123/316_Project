    "text": "Interior Improvement Act\n\nThis bill amends the Indian Reorganization Act to expand the definition of Indian to include members of Indian tribes that were federally recognized after June 18, 1934. Trust acquisitions by the Department of the Interior for tribes recognized after June 18, 1934, are ratified and confirmed.\n\nIndian tribes and individual Indians may apply to Interior to have off-reservation land taken into trust for the benefit of that Indian tribe or individual Indian. An application must include specified information, including a description of the need for the proposed acquisition and the purpose for which the property is to be used.\n\nInterior must publish these applications and notify jurisdictions contiguous to land included in an application.\n\nInterior must encourage applicants to enter into cooperative agreements with contiguous jurisdictions and must give preference to applications with cooperative agreements. An application with a cooperative agreement is automatically approved if Interior does not make a decision on the application within a specified number of days.\n\nIn making a decision on an application that does not include a cooperative agreement, Interior must consider whether anticipated economic impacts on contiguous jurisdictions have been mitigated and whether contiguous jurisdictions failed to work in good faith to reach an agreement with the applicant."
