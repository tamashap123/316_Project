    "text": "Coal Oversight and Leasing Reform Act of 2015 or the COAL Reform Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Mineral Leasing Act to repeal the requirement that the Department of the Interior offer under a deferred bonus lease payment system at least 50% of total acreage offered for coal leasing in any one year.\n\n Any independent consultants used by Interior for lease sales shall be subject to a nondisclosure agreement and any other confidentiality requirements.\n\nLicensees must certify the accuracy of exploration data they submit.\n\nA proposed lease sale may not be held until Interior determines, and includes in a formal appraisal report, the fair market value of the coal to be extracted.\n\nInterior must: (1) make publicly available appraisal reports, individual and total lease sales, high bids, royalty payments, and related revenues; and (2) find that a proposed coal leasing modification would not result in revenue reduction.\n\nThe total area of coal leasing modifications is reduced from 960 to 160 acres.\n\nInterior shall prepare, periodically revise, and maintain a coal leasing program consisting of a schedule of proposed lease sales indicating the size, timing, and location of leasing activity that will best meet national needs for the five-year period following approval or reapproval of the program.\n\n Annual lease rentals must be for at least $100 per acre, adjustable every 5 years.\n\nLease terms are reduced from 20 to 10 years. A lease which is not producing in commercial quantities shall be terminated at the end of 5 years.\n\nThe minimum lease royalty is increased from 12.5% of the value of the coal to 18.75%.\n\nBLM shall promulgate regulations for inspections and enforcement of coal operations, including oversight of state inspection and enforcement programs by its Washington, D.C. office. BLM may also assess civil penalties for noncompliance.\n\nThere shall be a moratorium on new coal lease sales until this Act has been implemented."
