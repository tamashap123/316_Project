    "text": "Military Sequester Flexibility Act \n\nThis bill permits the Department of Defense (DOD) to transfer authorizations of funds made available to DOD. DOD may transfer amounts between authorizations for the same fiscal year if: (1) the transfer is necessary to mitigate the effects of spending reductions due to a reduction in the discretionary spending limit or a sequestration under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and (2) it is in the national interest.\n\nTransfers in a fiscal year are limited to a total of $50 billion, excluding transfers between military personnel authorizations. The transfers must be used for higher priority items, may not be used for an item that has been denied an authorization by Congress, and may not reduce an authorization by more than 50%.\n\nDOD must notify Congress of each proposed transfer, and Congress may prohibit a transfer by enacting a joint resolution disapproving the transfer within 30 days of notification. The transfer authority expires on September 30, 2023."
