(Sec. 3) The head of each federal agency that is required to have a Chief Financial Officer shall designate a Program Management Improvement Officer to implement agency program management policies and develop a strategy for enhancing the role of program managers within the agency. The OMB must submit a report containing such strategy within one year after enactment of this Act.\n\nThe bill exempts DOD from such provisions to the extent that they are substantially similar to federal provisions governing the defense acquisition workforce.\n\nThe Program Management Policy Council is established within OMB to act as the principal interagency forum for improving agency practices related to program and project management.\n\n(Sec. 4) The Office of Personnel Management must issue regulations that: (1) identify key skills and competencies needed for an agency program and project manager, (2) establish a new job series or update and improve an existing job series for program and project management within an agency, and (3) establish a new career path for program and project managers.\n\n(Sec. 5) The GAO must issue a report within three years of enactment, in conjunction with its high risk list, examining the effectiveness of the following (as required or established under this Act) on improving federal program and project management:\n\n the standards, policies, and guidelines for program and project management; the strategic plan; Program Management Improvement Officers; and The Program Management Policy Council."
