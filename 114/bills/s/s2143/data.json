The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)\n\n(Sec. 1) This bill modifies the existing authority for the Starr-Camargo Bridge Company to maintain and operate a toll bridge across the Rio Grande River near Rio Grande City, Texas.\n\nThe authority, which currently expires 66 years after completion of the bridge (in 1966), is made permanent and expanded to include the successors or assigns of the company. The bridge must not consist of more than 14 lanes.\n\nThe company and its successors and assigns shall have the rights and privileges granted by federal law to the B and P Bridge Company, and may use eminent domain to acquire certain land needed for the bridge, subject to Texas laws and requirements for just compensation and public proceedings.\n\nThe company's successors and assigns may fix and charge tolls for transit over the bridge.\n\nThose successors and assigns may also sell, assign, transfer, or mortgage the rights, powers, and privileges conferred on the company by the enacting law, to any public agency, to an international bridge authority or commission, or to a corporation.\n\nAny such corporation may exercise such rights, powers, and privileges (including acquisition by mortgage foreclosure) as if they had been granted by the enacting law directly to the corporation."
