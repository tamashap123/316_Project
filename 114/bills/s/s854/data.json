Authorizes the Secretary to arrange for the Administrator to store defense wastes in storage facilities developed under this Act pending disposal in a repository.\n\nConfers upon the Administrator responsibility for transporting nuclear waste under this Act.\n\nEstablishes in the Treasury the Nuclear Waste Administration Working Capital Fund.\n\n Amends the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 to reflect the amendments made by this Act.\n\nTerminates those authorities of the Secretary regarding siting, construction, and operation of repositories, storage facilities, or test and evaluation facilities which were not transferred to the Administrator under this Act."
