These reporting requirements apply to any insured depository institution that:\n\n as of the most recent examination has a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (or an equivalent rating under a comparable rating system) for capital adequacy, assets, management capability, earnings, liquidity or asset liability management, and sensitivity to market risk; and satisfies other appropriate criteria as such agencies determine."
