(The Judgment Fund is a permanent and indefinite appropriation to pay judgments against the United States.)\n\nUnless the disclosure is prohibited by law or a court order, Treasury must disclose to the public on a website:\n\n the agency or entity whose actions gave rise to the claim or judgment, the plaintiff or claimant, the counsel for the plaintiff or claimant, the amount paid, a description of the facts that gave rise to the claim, and the agency that submitted the claim. If the payment is made to a foreign state, Treasury must also disclose:\n\n the method of payment; the currency denomination used for the payment; and the name and location of each financial institution owned or controlled by a foreign state or an agent of a foreign state through which the payment passed, from which the payment was withdrawn, or that is holding the payment. No payments from the fund may be made to a state sponsor of terrorism."
