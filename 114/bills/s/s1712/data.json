Requires any proceeds under this Act to be deposited in the special fund established under the Sisk Act and made available for:\n\n the acquisition of land or interests in land for administrative sites for the National Forest System (NFS) in the state from which the amounts were derived; the acquisition of land or interests in land for inclusion in the NFS in that state, including those which enhance opportunities for recreational access; the performance of deferred maintenance on administrative sites for the NFS in that state or other deferred maintenance activities in that state which enhance opportunities for recreational access; and the reimbursement of the USDA for costs incurred in preparing a competitive sale conducted under the authority of the Act."
