Establishes a Coordinating Committee on International Cultural Property Protection to facilitate the Coordinator's work.\n\nDirects the Department, through the U.S. Coordinator for International Cultural Property Protection, to report to Congress annually for seven years regarding activities of the U.S. Coordinator and the Coordinating Committee, the Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice to protect international cultural property.\n\nAuthorizes any agency involved in international cultural property protection activities to enter into agreements with the Smithsonian Institution to engage Smithsonian personnel temporarily to assist in such activities.\n\nDirects the President to apply specified import restrictions with respect to any archaeological or ethnological material of Syria as if Syria were a State Party to the Convention on prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export, and transfer of ownership of cultural property.\n\n Sets forth the conditions for termination of such restrictions.\n\n Authorizes the President to waive such import restrictions for specified cultural property if the President certifies to Congress that:\n\n the foreign owner or custodian of the specified cultural property has requested that such property be temporarily located in the United States for protection purposes, such property shall be returned upon request to the foreign owner or custodian, and the grant of a waiver will not contribute to illegal trafficking in cultural property or financing of criminal or terrorist activities."
