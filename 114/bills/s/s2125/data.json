At least 60% of these loans must be made to businesses in certain underserved markets, such as low- or moderate-income communities, HUBZones, empowerment zones, or enterprise communities.\n\nThe SBA must promulgate regulations for this Program, which shall be substantially similar to its Community Advantage Pilot Program, which shall terminate when these regulations take effect.\n\nThe Federal Home Loan Bank Act is amended to authorize Federal Home Loan Banks to make long-term secured advances to their members to provide funds to community development financial institutions.\n\nAt the time of origination or renewal of a loan or advance, a Bank must obtain and maintain a security interest in collateral eligible pursuant to any secured loan for any community development financial institution."
