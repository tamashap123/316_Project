The PBGC is financed by insurance premiums paid by sponsors of the plans, investment income, assets from pension plans taken over by the PBGC, and recoveries from the companies formerly responsible for the plans. This bill prevents increases in PBGC premiums from being used to pay for provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.)"
