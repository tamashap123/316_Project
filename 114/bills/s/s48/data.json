(Violators of title VI lose federal funding.)\n\nRequires a medical or mental health professional to report known or suspected violations to law enforcement authorities. Imposes criminal penalties for a failure to so report.\n\nProhibits a woman having such an abortion from being prosecuted or held civilly liable.\n\nProhibits this Act from being construed to require that a health care provider has an affirmative duty to inquire as to the motivation for the abortion, absent the health care provider having knowledge or information that the abortion is sought based on the sex or gender of the child."
