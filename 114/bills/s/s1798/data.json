    "text": "United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Reauthorization Act of 2015\n\nAmends the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 to reauthorize the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) as an independent federal government advisory body through FY2021.\n\nRequires the President's annual review of the status of religious freedom in each foreign country to include determinations regarding religious freedom violations being engaged in or tolerated in territories in which a government does not exist or does not exercise control. Directs the President to designate nonstate actors that have engaged in particularly severe violations as entities of particular concern for religious freedom.\n\nRequires USCIRF as a whole to have expertise on the variety of faiths practiced around the world.\n\nRequires appointments to USCIRF to be made not later than 90 days after the creation of a vacancy.\n\nDirects USCIRF, during its first meeting after May 30, 2016, to elect: (1) as Chair, a Commissioner appointed by an elected official of the political party of the President; and (2) as Vice Chair, a Commissioner appointed by an elected official of the political party that is not the political party of the President (or on the occasion of two Vice Chairs, one Vice Chair appointed by an elected official of the President's party and the other Vice Chair appointed by an elected official of the other party). Sets forth a process for future elections in which the positions of Chair and Vice Chair rotate annually between Commissioners appointed by elected officials of each political party.\n\nAllows the Ambassador at Large to attend all meetings as a nonvoting member.\n\nRemoves authority under which a USCIRF member may serve after the expiration of that member's term until a successor has taken office.\n\nRequires (currently, allows) USCIRF to hold hearings, take actions and testimony, and receive evidence.\n\nRequires USCIRF to conduct an annual review of the Executive Director.\n\nDirects USCIRF to work with the Executive Director to establish internal hiring practices for professional staff.\n\n Encourages the Department of State to allow classified information to be accessed by USCIRF Commissioners and staff with the appropriate security clearance.\n\nProhibits Commissioners from permitting any person, entity, or special interest group, including foreign governments and state-owned enterprises, to inappropriately influence or pose a conflict of interest with a Commissioner's official duties. Requires Commissioners to recuse themselves from related discussions or decisions if such an inappropriate influence or conflict is discovered.\n\nRevises restrictions on USCIRF's acceptance of gifts and donations to permit sponsoring private parties to provide compensation and benefits to interns, fellows, and volunteers under specified conditions.\n\nAmends the Foreign Service Act of 1980 to require the State Department to receive assistance from USCIRF when establishing training for Foreign Service officers in the field of internationally recognized human rights, including instruction regarding the relationship between religious freedom and security, as well as the role of religious freedom in U.S. foreign policy."
