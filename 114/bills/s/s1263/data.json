    "text": "Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Act of 2015\n\n This bill requires the Department of Commerce to: (1) establish a Clean Energy Technology Manufacturing and Export Assistance Fund to ensure that U.S. clean energy technology firms have the information and assistance they need to be competitive and to create clean energy technology sector jobs; and (2) administer the Fund to promote policies that will reduce production costs and encourage innovation, investment, and productivity in the clean energy technology sector, and implement a national clean energy technology export strategy. The Fund must be administered through the International Trade Administration.\n\nClean energy technology includes technology related to the production, use, transmission, storage, control, or conservation of energy that will contribute to a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through reduction, avoidance, or sequestration of energy-related emissions and that will: (1) reduce the need for additional energy supplies by using existing supplies with greater efficiency or by transmitting, distributing, or transporting energy with greater effectiveness through U.S. infrastructure; or (2) diversify the sources of the energy supply to strengthen energy security and to increase supplies with a favorable balance of environmental effects if the entire technology system is considered.\n\nCommerce must provide information, tools, and other assistance to U.S. businesses to promote clean energy technology manufacturing and facilitate the export of clean energy technology products and services. This assistance must be consistent with the National Export Initiative."
