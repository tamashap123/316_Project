Requires such information to include: (1) the number of individuals required by a court order to pay restitution in connection with a violation of each offense and the amount of such restitution; and (2) the age, gender, race, country of origin, country of citizenship, and description of the role of individuals convicted under each offense.\n\n(Sec. 4) Amends the VTVPA to require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), annually beginning in FY2017, to make grants for a national communication system to assist victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons in communicating with service providers. Directs HHS to give priority to grant applicants that have experience in providing telephone services to victims of severe forms of trafficking in persons.\n\n(Sec. 5) Amends the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act to include victims of a severe form of trafficking in persons among those eligible for the Job Corps without being required to demonstrate low-income eligibility.\n\n(Sec. 6) Amends the federal judicial code to authorize the United States Marshals Service to assist state, local, and other federal law enforcement agencies, upon request, in locating and recovering missing children.\n\n(Sec. 7) Directs the Attorney General to implement and maintain a National Strategy for Combating Human Trafficking that includes: (1) integrated federal, state, local, and tribal efforts to investigate and prosecute human trafficking cases; (2) case coordination within the Department of Justice; (3) annual budget priorities and federal efforts dedicated to preventing and combating human trafficking; (4) an ongoing assessment of future trends, challenges, and opportunities; and (5) encouragement of cooperation, coordination, and mutual support between the private sector and federal agencies to combat human trafficking."
