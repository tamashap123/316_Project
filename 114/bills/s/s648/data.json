Currently the Secretary of Health and Human Services is required to identify categories and classes of drugs of clinical concern.\n\nThe Secretary is required, however, to establish any exceptions that permit a PDP sponsor to exclude from its formulary a particular covered part D drug only through promulgation of a regulation, including a public notice and comment period."
