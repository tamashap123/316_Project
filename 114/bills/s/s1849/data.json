Such beneficiaries may submit a claim for Medicare payment in the amount that would otherwise apply, except that, where the professional is considered to be non-participating, payment shall be paid as if the professional were participating.\n\nAn \"eligible professional\" is\u00a0 a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, certified registered nurse anesthetist, certified nurse-midwife, clinical social worker, clinical psychologist, physical or occupational therapist, qualified speech-language pathologist, or qualified audiologist.\n\nA Medicare beneficiary must agree in writing in such a contract to: (1) pay the eligible professional for a Medicare-covered item or service; and (2) submit, in lieu of the eligible professional, a claim for Medicare payment. However, a beneficiary maynegotiate, as a term of the contract, for the eligible professional to file such claims on the beneficiary's behalf.\n\nThe bill preempts state laws from limiting the amount of charges for physician and practitioner services for which Medicare payment is made."
