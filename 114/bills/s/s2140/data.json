If such an entity or executive fails to warn affected employees and other individuals of a serious danger, they are subject to a fine and/or prison term of five years.\n\nThe bill makes it unlawful to knowingly discriminate or retaliate against an employee (i.e., a whistleblower) who warns other agencies or individuals of a serious danger associated with a product or service."
