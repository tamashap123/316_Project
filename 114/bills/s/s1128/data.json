    "text": "Early Pell Promise Act\n\nThis bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education to carry out a program of grants to state educational agencies (SEAs) under which a student who is in eighth grade and is eligible for a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act may be provided a commitment to receive a Federal Pell Grant early in the student's academic career.\n\nPursuant to such a commitment, the student receives a Pell Grant during the first two years of attendance at an institution of higher education (IHE) as an undergraduate if the student:\n\n files the FAFSA form during the senior year of secondary school and the succeeding year, and enrolls at the IHE not later than three years after receiving a secondary school diploma or after release from the Armed Forces. A student may not receive the early Pell Grant for a succeeding year if the expected family contribution for either year is more than twice the threshold amount for Pell Grant eligibility for that year.\n\nFunds are reserved for an independent evaluation of the program's impact.\n\nIn order to participate in the program, an SEA must develop a targeted information campaign and include in the plan for that campaign cost data disaggregated by institution type and information on both state and federal financial aid."
