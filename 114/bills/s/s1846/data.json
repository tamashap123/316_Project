    "text": "Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2016 or the CIPA\n\n(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to add as responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) relating to intelligence and analysis and infrastructure protection: (1) conducting an intelligence-based review and comparison of the risk and consequences to critical infrastructures of threats and hazards, including a geomagnetic disturbance (GMD) caused by a solar storm or another naturally occurring phenomenon and an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) caused by a nuclear device or non-nuclear device, including such a pulse caused by an act of terrorism; and (2) submitting and biennially updating a recommended strategy to protect and prepare the critical infrastructure of the American homeland against such threats.\n\nThe strategy: (1) shall be developed in consultation with the relevant federal sector-specific agencies and coordinating councils for critical infrastructures, and (2) may be incorporated into a broader DHS recommendation to help protect and prepare critical infrastructure from terrorism, cyber attacks, and other threats and hazards.\n\nThe Under Secretary for Science and Technology shall conduct research and development to mitigate the consequences of EMP and GMD threats, including:\n\n an objective scientific analysis of the risks to critical infrastructures from a range of such threats; determination of the critical utilities and national security assets and infrastructures that are at risk from such threats; an evaluation of emergency planning and response technologies that would address the findings and recommendations of experts, including those of the Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack; an analysis of available technology options to improve the resiliency of critical infrastructure to such threats; research regarding the restoration and recovery capabilities of critical infrastructure under differing levels of damage and disruption from such threats; and an analysis of the feasibility of a real-time alert system to inform electric grid operators and other stakeholders within milliseconds of a high-altitude nuclear explosion. The bill requires the Secretary to: (1) develop an incident annex or similar response and planning strategy that guides the response to a major GMD or EMP event; and (2) conduct outreach to educate owners and operators of critical infrastructure, emergency planners, and emergency response providers at all levels of government regarding EMP and GMD threats.\n\nThe Secretary shall submit a report to Congress within 180 days on the progress made in, and an estimated completion date for: (1) including threats of EMP and GMD in national planning; (2) conducting the research and development, and developing the strategy, required under this bill; and (3) beginning to conduct outreach to educate emergency planners and emergency response providers at all levels of government regarding EMP and GMD threats."
