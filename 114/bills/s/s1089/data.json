Requires applications to include a feasibility study, funded under this Act, which contains specified information.\n\nRequires the Secretary to decide whether to enter into such a contract within six months after receiving an application.\n\nRequires independent evaluation to determine whether the state or local government project has met an outcome specified in the contract in order for such governments to receive outcome payments.\n\nEstablishes the Federal Interagency Council on Social Impact Partnerships.\n\nMakes appropriations for 10 years to carry out this Act.\n\nAuthorizes the Government Accountability Office to audit the social impact partnership project activities of any state, local, government, or nongovernment entity that receives funds under this Act.\n\nAmends the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 to require the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to consider, in assessing and taking into account the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its entire community, its investments in social impact partnership projects."
