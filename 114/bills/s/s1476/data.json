Requires such information to include:\n\n the gender, race, ethnicity, and age of each individual who was shot, injured, or killed; the date, time, and location of the incident; whether the civilian was armed and, if so, the type of weapon; the type of force used against the officer, the civilian, or both; the number of officers and civilians involved; and a brief description regarding the circumstances surrounding the incident. Authorizes a grant to be used for:\n\n the cost of complying with such reporting requirements; the cost of establishing necessary systems required to investigate and report incidents; public awareness campaigns designed to gain information from the public on use of force against police officers; and use of force training for law enforcement agencies and personnel. Directs the Attorney General: (1) to publish an annual report containing the information reported, and (2) in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to issue guidance on best practices relating to establishing standard data collection systems that capture such information."
