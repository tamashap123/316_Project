The President shall establish a lithium battery safety working group to promote and coordinate efforts related to the promotion of the safe manufacture, use, and transportation of lithium batteries and cells.\n\nThe working group shall research:\n\n additional ways to decrease the risk of fires and explosions from lithium batteries and cells, additional ways to ensure uniform transportation requirements for both bulk and individual batteries, and new or existing technologies that could reduce the fire and explosion risk of lithium batteries and cells."
