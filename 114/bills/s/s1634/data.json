This covers motor carriers, water carriers, brokers, freight forwarders, and pipeline carriers.\n\nDeclares that, in any civil action against a rail common carrier, the U.S. district court shall not be required to defer to the primary jurisdiction of the STB.\n\nEmpowers the Federal Trade Commission to regulate, and engage in antitrust enforcement regarding, collective rate agreements and certain transactions, including railroad mergers and acquisitions.\n\nPermits treble damages against common carrier railroads in antitrust suits to parties injured by antitrust violations without regard to whether such railroads have filed rates or whether a complaint challenging rates has been filed.\n\nAmends federal transportation law to terminate the exemptions from antitrust laws for collective ratemaking agreements.\n\nRequires the STB, when reviewing a proposed agreement, to take into account its impact upon shippers, consumers, and affected communities.\n\nExempts from antitrust law the pooling of railroad cars approved by the STB or its predecessor agency."
