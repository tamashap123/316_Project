Requires the first report to include recommendations based on an evaluation of prostate cancer research and gaps in the development and validation of diagnostic tools for prostate cancer. Requires subsequent reports to include an outline for a national research plan, roles for specified agencies, an analysis of the disparities in the incidence and mortality of prostate cancer in high-risk men, and a review of the progress towards the realization of the strategic plan.\n\nTerminates the Council on December 31, 2020."
