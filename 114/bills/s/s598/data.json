Makes individuals with ESRD eligible for Medicare Advantage.\n\nAllows dialysis facilities to provide kidney disease education services and allows physician assistants, nurse practitioners, or clinical nurse specialists to refer individuals to those services.\n\nRequires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish an ESRD Care Coordination program to provide higher Medicare payments to nephrologists, dialysis facilities, and other providers that reduce spending on ESRD by being part of a coordinated care organization.\n\nAmends the Public Health Service Act to include dialysis as a service provided by the National Health Service Corps in health professional shortage areas. Makes nephrologists and non-physician practitioners who provide dialysis eligible for the National Health Service Corps Scholarship Program and Loan Repayment Program.\n\nRequires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report identifying gaps in chronic kidney disease research and comparing research funding to expenditures on disease treatment. Requires HHS to report on: (1) the causes of kidney disease and efforts to treat kidney disease in disproportionately affected minority populations, and (2) disincentives in Medicare payment systems that create barriers to kidney transplants and post-transplant care for beneficiaries with ESRD."
