Requires a state's application for a grant under part A to recruit, train, and retain highly qualified teachers and principals to describe all of the subjects the state identifies as workforce critical subjects.\n\nAmends part B (21st Century Community Learning Centers) of title IV of the ESEA to require states that receive a part B allotment to consider, in evaluating subgrant applications, the likelihood that a subgrant applicant's community learning center will help secondary school students achieve career competencies, complete internships or apprenticeships, or participate in work-based learning opportunities. (Subgrants are awarded on a competitive basis to local educational agencies, community-based organizations, and other public or private entities to establish or expand before school, after school, and summer recess community learning center programs.)\n\nAuthorizes subgrantees to establish community learning center programs that partner with in-demand fields of the local workforce or build career competencies and career readiness."
