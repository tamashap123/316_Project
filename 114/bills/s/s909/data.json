The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nPhilanthropic Enterprise Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 2) Amends the Internal Revenue Code to exempt the holdings of a private foundation in any business enterprise that meet specified requirements relating to exclusive ownership, minimum distribution of\u00a0net operating income for the charitable purpose (all profits to charity), and independent operation (i.e., not controlled by a substantial contributor or family members) from the excise tax on excess business holdings, in taxable years beginning after 2014. Makes such exemption inapplicable to donor advised funds or supporting organizations that are subject to excess business holdings rules and certain charitable and split interest trusts."
