Such rules do not apply, however, to off-the-shelf orthotics furnished on or after January 1, 2016, which are included in a competitive acquisition program.\n\nDecisions about Medicare coverage of orthotics and prosthetics on or after January 1, 2016, must take into account the complexity of the item as well as supplier qualifications (which do not apply, however, to physicians, occupational therapists, or physical therapists state-licensed to provide such items).\n\nDocumentation created by an orthotist or prosthetist is considered part of the patient's medical record.\n\nRequirements for suppliers of orthotics and prosthetics are separated from those for suppliers of durable medical equipment.\n\nOrthotists and prosthetists must have a supplier number for Medicare payment to be made.\n\nPatients are not liable for payment of furnished orthotics or prosthetics where payment may not be made or where payment is denied. Only the orthotists or prosthetists are liable in such circumstances.\n\nOnly the patient may make the minimal self-adjustment required to qualify off-the-shelf orthotics for Medicare coverage in a competitive acquisition program."
