Subjects to fines and/or imprisonment any person who knowingly performs an abortion but fails to comply with this Act.\n\nProhibits a woman upon whom an abortion is performed from being prosecuted for conspiracy to violate this Act.\n\nRequires each abortion clinic that receives federal funds or assistance to be licensed by the state and be in compliance with the requirements for ambulatory surgery centers under title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act, except for requirements related to a certificate of public need. Allows a state board of health to waive the application of certain structural requirements for licensing purposes in order to comply with this Act."
