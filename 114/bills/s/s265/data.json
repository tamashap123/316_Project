(Opportunity scholarships are provided to low-income students in the District of Columbia to enable them to attend the District of Columbia private elementary or secondary school of their choice.)\n\nAmends the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to allow states that have established a program allowing the parents of disabled children to use public or private funds to send their children to a private school to use their allocation of special education funds to supplement those funds.\n\nAuthorizes grants for the improvement of special education services to be used for the planning, design, and initial implementation, during a period of up to three years, of state programs that allow the parents of a disabled child to make a genuine independent choice of the appropriate public or private school for their child.\n\nSets forth requirements for those programs, including that they: (1) permit parents to receive state funds to pay some or all of the costs of their disabled child's attendance at the selected school, or (2) permit persons to receive a state tax credit for donations to an entity that provides funds to enable parents to pay some or all of the costs of their disabled child's attendance at that school.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Defense to carry out a five-year pilot program to award scholarships to enable military dependent students who live on military installations to attend the public or private elementary or secondary schools their parents choose rather than those assigned to them.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Defense to select at least five military installations to participate in the program and choose those where military students would most benefit from expanded education options.\n\nDirects the Secretary of Defense to use a random process to select scholarship recipients if more students apply for the scholarships than can be accommodated.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Education to return to the Treasury specified amounts made available for Department of Education salaries and expenses."
