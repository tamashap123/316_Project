The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nGlobal Food Security Act of 2016 \n\nThis bill requires the President to develop and implement a Global Food Security Strategy to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition.\n\n(Sec. 3) This section specifies that it is in the U.S. national interest to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans through programs and activities that:\n\n place food insecure countries on a path toward self-sufficiency and economic freedom by coordinating U.S. assistance programs; accelerate inclusive, agricultural-led economic growth that reduces global poverty, hunger, and malnutrition; increase the productivity, incomes, and livelihoods of small-scale producers; build resilience to food shocks among vulnerable populations and households while reducing reliance upon emergency food assistance; create an environment for agricultural growth and investment; improve the nutritional status of women and children; demonstrably meet, align with, and leverage U.S strategies and investments in trade, economic growth, national security, science and technology, agriculture research and extension, maternal and child health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and hygiene; strengthen partnerships between U.S. and foreign universities that build agricultural capacity; and ensure the effective use of taxpayer dollars in furthering these objectives. (Sec. 4) This section sets forth definitions that apply to this bill.\n\n(Sec. 5) The President must coordinate a whole-of-government strategy to promote global food security, resilience, and nutrition, consistent with national food security investment plans.\n\nThis section specifies required goals and criteria for the strategy. The President must coordinate the efforts of federal departments and agencies to implement the strategy by establishing:\n\n monitoring and evaluation systems, coherence, and coordination across federal departments and agencies; linkages with other initiatives and strategies of federal departments and agencies; and platforms for regular consultation and collaboration with key stakeholders and congressional committees.
