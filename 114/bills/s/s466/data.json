Any entity awarded a grant or contract by HHS to develop emerging and innovative evidence-based measures under the Maternal and Infant Quality Measurement Program shall work to advance eMeasures aligned with those developed under the Pediatric Quality Measures Program and the Medicaid Quality Measurement Program.\n\nThe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality shall adapt the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems program surveys of providers, facilities, and health plans to ensure that the adapted surveys are effective in measuring aspects of care that childbearing women and newborns experience.\n\nStates with an approved Medicaid or CHIP plan or waiver shall report annually to HHS regarding state specific maternal and infant quality of care measures applied.\n\n(Sec. 3) HHS may make grants to eligible entities to support:\n\n the development of new state and regional maternity and infant care quality collaboratives; expanded activities of existing collaboratives; and maternity and infant care initiatives within established state and regional quality collaboratives that are not focused exclusively on maternity care. An online, open-access clearinghouse shall be established to make protocols, procedures, reports, tools, and other resources of individual collaboratives available to collaboratives and other entities working to improve maternity and infant care quality.\n\n(Sec. 4) The consensus-based entity regarding performance measurement with which HHS must contract shall facilitate increased coordination and alignment between the public and private sector with respect to quality and efficiency measures."
