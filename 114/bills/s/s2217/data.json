The nutrient content disclosure statement on the menu or menu board must include: (1) the number of calories contained in the whole menu item; (2) the number of servings and number of calories per serving; or (3) the number of calories per common unit of the item, such as for a multi-serving item that is typically divided before presentation to the consumer. Nutritional information may be provided solely by a remote-access menu (e.g., an Internet menu) for food establishments where the majority of orders are placed by customers who are off-premises.\n\nEstablishments with self-serve food may comply with the requirements for restaurants or place signs with nutritional information adjacent to each food item.\n\nAn establishment\u2019s nutrient content disclosures have a \u201creasonable basis\u201d if they are within acceptable allowances for variation, including variations in serving size or ingredients and inadvertent human error in formulation.\n\nEstablishments with standard menu items that come in different flavors, varieties, or combinations, that are listed as a single menu item can determine and disclose nutritional information using specified methods or methods allowed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nRegulations pursuant to this Act or the clause amended by this Act cannot take effect earlier than two years after final regulations are promulgated pursuant to this Act.\n\nThe FDA may not exempt states from nutrition labeling requirements."
