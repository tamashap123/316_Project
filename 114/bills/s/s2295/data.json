The bill postpones the effective date of these amendments, which are currently scheduled to take effect 180 days after the USA FREEDOM Act was enacted on June 2, 2015, to: (1) January 31, 2017; or (2) the date that the President certifies to Congress that such amendments will have no operational impacts on the intelligence community.\n\nThe bill also amends the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 to make permanent expiring FISA authorities concerning: (1) roving electronic surveillance orders, and (2) a revised definition of \"agent of a foreign power\" that includes any non-U.S. persons who engage in international terrorism or preparatory activities (commonly referred to as the \"lone wolf\" provision)."
