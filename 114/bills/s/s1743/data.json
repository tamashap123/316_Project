    "text": "Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 2015\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Transportation (DOT) to:\n\n promulgate regulations establishing categories of early warning motor vehicle safety information, especially about fatal incidents, that must be made available to the public; and take specified steps to improve public accessibility to information on vehicle safety databases of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The DOT Inspector General shall report biennially on the pre-investigation processes of the NHTSA Office of Defects Investigation to collect and analyze vehicle safety data and determine potential safety issues.\n\nDOT shall report on the operations of the Council for Vehicle Electronics, Vehicle Software, and Emerging Technologies.\n\nThe bill increases civil money penalties for motor vehicle safety violations, and establishes both civil and criminal penalties for knowing failure of a business entity or responsible corporate officer to inform an appropriate federal agency of a serious danger associated with covered products, services, or business practices.\n\nIn conducting motor vehicle safety research programs, DOT shall, in coordination with Department of State, enter into cooperative and collaborative research and development agreements with foreign governments.\n\nDOT must immediately notify and order motor vehicle or replacement equipment manufacturers of defects or noncompliance presenting an imminent hazard.\n\nNo dealer may sell or lease a used passenger motor vehicle until any defect or noncompliance presenting an imminent hazard has been remedied.\n\nDOT shall:\n\n complete research into development of an unattended children warning system, initiate a rulemaking to require crash avoidance and mitigation systems for certain motor vehicles, and issue a final rule establishing hood and bumper standards for certain other motor vehicles to reduce the pedestrian injuries and fatalities. The bill reauthorizes motor vehicle safety regulation through FY2021.\n\nA manufacturer's recall obligations shall be enforceable against the manufacturer or successors-in-interest whether accomplished by merger, acquisition of the manufacturer's stock, acquisition of its assets, or confirmation of a reorganization plan under federal bankruptcy law.\n\nDealers must check for and remedy defective or noncomplying motor vehicles.\n\nDOT shall initiate a rulemaking, establish grants to states, and conduct a pilot program relating to safety recalls."
