DOE shall submit to Congress three alternative 10-year budget plans for civilian nuclear energy research and development.\n\nThe NRC shall report to Congress on:\n\n the extent to which it is capable of licensing advanced reactor designs developed under this bill by the end of a specified four-year period, and any organizational or institutional barriers it will need to overcome to be able to license such designs."
