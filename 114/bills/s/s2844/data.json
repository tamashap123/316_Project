The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund.\n\nThe bill decreases net discretionary budget authority for Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies below FY2016 levels. (When savings due to certain rescissions and receipts are taken into account, the new discretionary budget authority available to agencies funded in the bill is above the FY2016 level.)\n\nCompared to FY2016 levels, the bill decreases discretionary funding for DOT (including the effects of a rescission of unused contract authority) and increases discretionary funding for HUD.\n\nThe bill also includes a provision that affects DOT regulations regarding commercial truck drivers' rest periods.\n\nFull Summary:\n\n Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nDepartment of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2017 \n\nTITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\n\nProvides FY2017 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT).\n\nProvides appropriations for the Office of the Secretary, including:\n\n Salaries and Expenses; Research and Technology; National Infrastructure Investments (also known as TIGER grants); the National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau; Financial Management Capital; Cyber Security Initiatives; the Office of Civil Rights; Transportation Planning, Research, and Development; the Working Capital Fund; the Minority Business Resource Center Program; Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and Outreach; and Payments to Air Carriers.
