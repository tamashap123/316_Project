An \"open\" recommendation is one that has been made publicly available on such website but has not been adopted or implemented by such Inspector General's establishment.\n\nThe list shall include:\n\n the number of recommendations issued by the Inspector General for the fiscal year and the number that are open, each report in which an open recommendation was issued, the assigned number and a short description of each open recommendation, the date the open recommendation was first issued and its current status, and any comments of the Inspector General relating to why the recommendation remains open and any response from the establishment. The list shall be updated by the Inspector General at least every six months."
