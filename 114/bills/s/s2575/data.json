These costs must be incurred with respect to an eligible dwelling and the credit for such costs is generally limited to $5,000 for any eligible dwelling in any taxable year, reduced by costs taken into account in previous taxable years.\n\nThe bill defines an \"eligible dwelling\" generally as a dwelling unit that is: (1) placed in service before 1950; (2) located in the United States; and (3) a house, apartment, condominium, mobile home, boat, or similar property, but not a unit used exclusively as a hotel, motel, inn, or similar establishment."
