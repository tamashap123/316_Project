Authorizes: (1) the Secretary of Commerce to transfer such critical functions to another office of the Department of Commerce, excluding any fee-based services offered by the NTIS; and (2) the General Services Administration or any federal agency receiving critical fee-based services from an NTIS contractor to enter into a new contract to continue such services. Terminates all other NTIS functions.\n\nRequires the Secretary of Commerce to certify that all NTIS operations have been terminated. Directs the Secretary of the Treasury to: (1) transfer all unexpended balances in the NTIS Revolving Fund to the Treasury general fund for the purpose of deficit reduction, and (2) dissolve such Fund."
