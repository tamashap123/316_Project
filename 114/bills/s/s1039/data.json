Requires the DOE Inspector General to issue a public report evaluating the completeness of the DOE asset inventory.\n\nRequires the Office of E-Government and Information Technology to: (1) establish the deadline, on an annual basis, for agencies to submit information required by this Act; (2) develop and publish a goal for the total amount of planned cost savings through the Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative during a five-year period and report on the actual savings achieved through the Initiative; and (3) report to Congress on DOE data center cost savings. Directs the Government Accountability Office to publish an annual report on DOE asset inventory and consolidation plans and DOE's implementation of such plans.\n\nRequires DOE to migrate to cloud computing in a manner consistent with federal guidelines on cloud computing security, including applicable provisions in the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program of the General Services Administration and guidance published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nAuthorizes the Director of National Intelligence to waive requirements of this Act for any element of the intelligence community.\n\nRepeals this Act effective on October 1, 2019."
