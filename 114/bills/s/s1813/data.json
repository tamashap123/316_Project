Grant recipients may: (1) allocate amounts to subrecipients that are public agencies or private nonprofit organizations engaged in public transportation, and (2) obligate funds for three fiscal years after the fiscal year in which the amount is appropriated.\n\nThe bill limits to 4% the percentage of funding made available for this Act in a fiscal year that may be provided to a single recipient."
