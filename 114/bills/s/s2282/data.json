(These programs help match patients in need of a transplant with unrelated bone marrow and cord blood donors.)\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) must review the state of the science of using adult stem cells and birthing tissues to develop new therapies and consider the inclusion of new therapies in the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program. Requirements for HHS contracts under the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 are revised.\n\nHHS must determine whether to include peripheral blood stem cells and umbilical cord blood in the definition of human organ."
