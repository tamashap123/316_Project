Prohibits also an award to any whistleblower who knowingly and willfully makes false representations. Subjects such a whistleblower to criminal penalties.\n\nRequires nondisclosure of a whistleblower's identity, except in specified circumstances.\n\nAuthorizes a whistleblower to appeal Secretary determinations in the appropriate U.S. court of appeals."
