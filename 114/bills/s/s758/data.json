Establishes in the Center the position of a Director, who shall be the Deputy USTR for Trade Enforcement to head the Trade Enforcement Division, as well as a Deputy Director and an Intelligence Community Liaison.\n\nEstablishes within the Office of the USTR a Chief Manufacturing Negotiator to conduct trade negotiations and enforce trade agreements relating to U.S. manufacturing products and services.\n\nMakes it the principal functions of the Deputy USTR for Trade Enforcement to:\n\n ensure that U.S. trading partners comply with trade agreements to which the United States is a party, and assist the USTR in investigating and prosecuting disputes before the World Trade Organization and pursuant to other bilateral or regional trade agreements to which the United States is a party. Makes it the principal function of the Chief Manufacturing Negotiator to act as a vigorous advocate on behalf of this country's manufacturing interests."
