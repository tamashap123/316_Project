(Sec. 3) Shields the Corporation from being liable for soil, surface water, groundwater, or other contamination resulting from the disposal, release, or presence of environmental contamination (including oil or petroleum products, hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous waste, pollutants, toxic substances, solid waste, or any other environmental contamination or hazard under any federal or Alaska law).\n\nAccords to HHS any easement or access to the conveyed property as may be necessary to satisfy any retained obligations and liability.\n\nRequires the HHS to be in compliance with requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 respecting certain deeds for the transfer of U.S. owned real property on which any hazardous substance was stored for one year or more, disposed of, or known to have been released."
