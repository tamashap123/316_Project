Assistance and training shall also promote observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms and respect for legitimate civilian authority.\n\nDOD may use funds provided for by this bill to pay incremental training-connected expenses if such payment will facilitate the participation of organization personnel in Brunei, Singapore, and Taiwan.\n\n The Arms Export Control Act is amended to extend special foreign military sales status to the Philippines.\n\nFY2017 international military education and training funds and foreign military financing assistance funds are authorized for activities in the region.\n\nThe Department of State may prioritize the provision of maritime capacity building assistance to countries in the region that will contribute to the same objectives as provided in this bill for DOD.\n\nFY2017 funds are authorized for support of the Southeast Asia Maritime Law Enforcement Initiative.\n\nThe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 is amended to give priority for the transfer of excess defense articles to: (1) other major U.S. non-North American Treaty Organization allies in the region (including Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Australia, and New Zealand); and (2) other Association of Southeast Asian Nations maritime states.\n\nThe bill authorizes the transfer of one OLIVER HAZARD PERRY class guided missile frigate on a grant basis to a foreign government pursuant to the Maritime Security Initiative.\n\nThe President shall ensure that the U.S. government treats every proposed arms sale for Taiwan with the same time lines, processes, and procedures accorded to proposed arms transfers for all other countries."
