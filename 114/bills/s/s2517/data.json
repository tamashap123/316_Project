The evaluation, to be submitted within 180 days after enactment of this bill, must:\n\n recommend improvements to the federal government's efforts to monitor, review, disrupt, and counter the use of social media by terrorists and terrorist organizations; analyze how the federal government is using social media to counter terrorist propaganda and radicalization, and how such tactics fit within the broader efforts of the federal government to combat domestic terrorism and international terrorism; and assess again any impact the efforts of the federal government to combat terrorists' and terrorist organizations' use of social media may have upon the civil rights and liberties of U.S. persons who are not engaged in terrorist activities. (Sec. 4) The President, within 180 days after enactment of this bill, must also transmit to Congress a comprehensive strategy to counter terrorists' and terrorist organizations' use of social media, as committed to in the President's 2011 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States."
