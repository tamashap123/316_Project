A new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) may not apply to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit application until the EPA publishes final implementation regulations and guidance that include information relating to submission and consideration of a preconstruction permit application under the standard.\n\nThe EPA must submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits."
