In addition, no person may sell ammunition to any individual subject to a prevention order.\n\nThe bill is designed to allow family members and associates to petition a court to issue a gun violence prevention order to any individual who may pose a danger to themselves or others. States are allowed to temporarily seize firearms from individuals who have been issued a prevention order. Individuals who have their firearms seized are given an opportunity to petition the court for an order allowing them to regain possession of their firearms.\n\nThe Department of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services is authorized to issue grant funds to assist states in implementing this bill."
