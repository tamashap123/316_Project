    "text": "Reclassification to Ensure Smarter and Equal Treatment Act of 2015 or the RESET Act\n\n Amends the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to reduce penalties (to not greater than a one-year term of imprisonment and/or a $1,000 fine) for simple possession of a controlled substance by a person who has one or more prior convictions for a controlled substance offense.\n\nRepeals a provision providing for up to three years' imprisonment for the possession of flunitrazepam. Revises penalties for possession of drugs classified as date rape drugs after a prior drug-related conviction.\n\nReduces the maximum term of imprisonment (to one year) for the sale, use of the mails to transport, or importation or exportation of drug paraphernalia.\n\nEliminates provisions of the CSA and the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act that apply the same penalties applicable to offenses involving a specified amount of a substance containing cocaine to offenses involving a lesser amount of a substance containing cocaine base.\n\nAmends the CSA to provide that in determining the weight of a controlled substance or mixture of controlled substances that is in a compound with a food product for purposes of provisions concerning controlled substance offenses, the weight of the food product shall not be included.\n\nMakes this Act applicable to any offense committed before its enactment, if a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of such enactment date. Provides for the reduction of the term of imprisonment of a defendant who was convicted and sentenced before such date for an offense for which the penalty is amended by this Act.\n\nDirects the Sentencing Commission to review and, if appropriate, amend the federal sentencing guidelines and policy statements applicable to any person convicted of an offense affected by this Act.\n\nEstablishes within the Department of Justice the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Fund, which (subject to specified limitations) shall be disbursed as follows by August 15 of each fiscal year beginning in 2016:\n\n 15% to the Department of Education to administer a grant program to public agencies aimed at improving outcomes for public school pupils in kindergarten and grades 1 to 12 by reducing truancy and supporting students who are at risk of dropping out or are victims of crime; 10% to the Federal Crime Victim Assistance Fund to make grants to trauma recovery centers to provide services to victims of crime; 25% to Federal Reentry/Drug Court programs to administer a grant program to public agencies aimed at supporting mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, and diversion programs for people in the criminal justice system; and 50% to the General Treasury in order to pay down the national debt."
