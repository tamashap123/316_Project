    "text": "Requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to fully utilize surveillance and detection capabilities developed or used by federal agencies to enhance the functioning and operational capability to conduct continuous and integrated manned or unmanned monitoring, sensing, or surveillance of 100% of the southern border of the United States.\n\nProhibits DHS from procuring any additional unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) until it provides written certification that it successfully operated its current UAS fleet at least 23,000 hours during the preceding calendar year. Excepts the procurement of unmanned aircraft that do not weigh more than 150 pounds.\n\nRequires DHS to: (1) use the best available radar and surveillance technology to increase awareness of illegal border activities along the southern border and to identify gaps in surveillance capabilities; and (2) consult with the Department of Defense to identify best practices that could be used by DHS to improve the security of the southern border.\n\nDirects DHS to report biannually on:\n\n the number of UAS flight hours required, planned, and flown to provide persistent surveillance along the southern border and the number of flight hours cancelled; the number of UAS flight hours planned in support of any federal or state agency; performance measures regarding the number of hours flown, subjects detected, and apprehensions and illicit drug seizures assisted; and the accumulated cost associated with the UAS Program. Terminates this Act five years after its enactment."
