Directs: (1) each agency to submit to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) annually a list of the rules, by category, that the agency published during the preceding year; and (2) OIRA to publish each list and an estimate of the costs and benefits of each included rule on www.reginfo.gov.\n\nDefines \"significant economic impact\" for purposes of provisions concerning initial and final regulator flexibility analyses as an annual economic effect of at least $100 million."
