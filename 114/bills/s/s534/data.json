Such memoranda or substantially similar policy changes are declared to have no statutory or constitutional basis and therefore no legal effect.\n\nNo funds or fees made available to the Secretary or to any federal official may be used to grant any federal benefit to any alien pursuant to any of such policy changes.\n\nNo funds or fees made available to the Secretary may be used to carry out any policy relating to the apprehension, detention, or removal of aliens that does not treat any alien convicted of any offense involving domestic violence, sexual abuse, child molestation, or child exploitation as within the categories of aliens subject to the highest DHS civil immigration enforcement priorities.\n\nIt is the sense of Congress that:\n\n disparate employer/employee health insurance requirements discourage the hiring of U.S. citizens and those in lawful immigration status; and the Executive Branch should refrain from pursuing policies such as granting to unlawfully present individuals any deferred action under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program and work authorization. It is the sense of Congress that U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service should:\n\n stop putting the interests of aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States ahead of the interests of aliens who are following proper immigration laws and procedures by taking specified actions, and use the funds available under existing law to improve services and increase the efficiency of the immigration benefits application process for aliens abroad or who are lawfully present in the United States."
