Supplemental reports are also authorized. Boards of inquiry are limited to one that may appointed for each dispute during a 90-day period.\n\nGovernors may also petition for injunctions against such labor or management actions affecting ports in their states or territories.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board, for each dispute, shall take not more than one secret ballot for the same employees in any 30-day period."
