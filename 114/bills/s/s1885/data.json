The VA housing assistance program is expanded to include: (1) veterans and their families who are at risk of becoming homeless, and very low-income veteran families; and (2) assistance for acquiring and transitioning to, and maintaining occupancy in, permanent housing.\n\nThe VA shall:\n\n conduct outreach to realtors, landlords, property management companies, and developers to educate them about the housing needs of veterans and the benefits of having veterans as tenants; and establish and operate a National Center on Homelessness Among Veterans which shall carry out research into the causes of and contributing factors to veteran homelessness, assess the effectiveness of VA homeless veterans programs, and serve as a center for the exchange of information regarding activities carried out by the VA and by other federal and non-federal entities for veteran homelessness. Each year the VA shall review each grant recipient and eligible entity that received a per diem payment for furnishing services to homeless veterans to evaluate its performance with respect to:\n\n the success of the grant recipient or eligible entity in assisting veterans to obtain, transition into, and retain permanent housing; and increasing the income of veterans by helping them obtain either employment or appropriate income-related benefits."
