Defines \"space resource\" as a natural resource of any kind found in place in outer space.\n\nDirects the President to report recommendations for: (1) allocating responsibilities relating to the exploration and utilization of space resources among federal agencies, and (2) any authorities necessary to meet U.S international obligations with respect to the exploration and utilization of space resources.\n\nDeclares that any asteroid resources obtained in outer space are the property of the entity that obtained them.\n\nRequires a U.S. commercial space resource utilization entity to avoid causing harmful interference in outer space. Authorizes such an entity to bring a civil action for appropriate relief for any action by another entity subject to U.S. jurisdiction causing harmful interference to its operations with respect to an asteroid resource utilization activity in outer space."
