Neither shall the designation affect the operation of, or impose any flow or release requirements on, the unlicensed hydroelectric facility at the Dam and Reservoir.\n\n The Lower Farmington River shall not be administered as part of the National Park System or be subject to System regulations.\n\n(Sec. 5) The bill also revises the description of a specified designated segment of the Farmington River in Connecticut."
