DHS shall enter into a memorandum of understanding with HHS to: (1) define each department's roles and responsibilities, and (2) establish appropriate performance metrics or policies.\n\nDHS must submit annual reports on program progress and results, which shall include the costs to administer the program, the number of eligible providers that volunteer to participate and that obtain the necessary vaccinations, the total number of doses of vaccine administered, and recommendations to improve participation.\n\n The final report shall include an analysis of the costs and benefits of continuing the program, an explanation of the economic, health, and other benefits of administering vaccines through the program rather than post-event treatment, and a plan under which the program could be continued."
