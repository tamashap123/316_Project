The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\n(Sec. 1) This bill extends federal contractor whistleblower protections to employees of: (1) personal services contractors working on defense contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of defense contractors, subcontractors, grantees, or subgrantees); and (2) personal services contractors or subgrantees working on federal civilian contracts (currently, the protections apply to employees of civilian contractors, subcontractors, or grantees). The civilian contractor protections, which are currently in effect as a pilot program, are made permanent.\n\nThe bill extends the prohibition against reimbursement of legal fees incurred in defending against reprisal claims brought by whistleblowers to defense and civilian subcontractors and personal services contractors."
