(Currently, the FDA is required to consider the least burdensome appropriate means for a device sponsor to demonstrate the effectiveness of a device or its substantial equivalence to an approved device.) The FDA must periodically assess the implementation of those requirements.\n\nThe ombudsman for any applicable unit of the FDA must conduct an audit of the training on least burdensome requirements.\n\nThe FDA must consider: (1) the least burdensome appropriate means necessary to demonstrate device safety and effectiveness when requesting additional information from a device sponsor to support a premarket approval application, and (2) whether the least burdensome means would be reliance on postmarket information. The documentation of rationale for an applicable significant decision must include an explanation of how the least burdensome requirements were considered and applied.\n\nThe Institutional Review Board responsible for reviewing the plan for the clinical testing of a medical device no longer needs to be local to the facilities where the testing will be conducted.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services must revise its guidance entitled \"Recommendations for Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) Waiver Applications for Manufacturers of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices.\""
