  <description>An amendment numbered 66 printed in Part B of House Report 116-119 to increase funding for the John R. Justice Program by $2,000,000, to provide student loan repayment assistance for public defenders and prosecutors. This program is intended to serve as an incentive for qualified individuals to enter and continue employment as public defenders or prosecutors- without this vital funding, the program will continue to fall short of its mission.</description>
