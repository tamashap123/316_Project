    "text": "This concurrent resolution establishes the congressional budget for the federal government for FY2020 and sets forth budgetary levels for FY2021-FY2024.\n\nThe resolution recommends levels and amounts for FY2020-FY2024 for\n\n federal revenues, new budget authority, budget outlays, deficits, public debt, debt held by the public, and the major functional categories of spending. It also recommends levels and amounts for FY2020-FY2024 in the Senate for Social Security and Postal Service discretionary administrative expenses.\n\nThe resolution includes reconciliation instructions that direct five Senate committees to report and submit to the Senate Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit over FY2020-FY2024 by specified amounts. The committees include\n\n the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee; the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee; the Senate Finance Committee; the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. (Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.)\n\nThe resolution establishes several deficit-neutral reserve funds that provide flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to legislation addressing a wide range of specified issues across the federal budget.\n\nIt also sets forth budget enforcement procedures for legislation considered in the Senate."
