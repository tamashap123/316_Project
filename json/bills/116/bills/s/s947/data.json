    "text": "Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2019\n\nThis bill increases the amount of compensation provided to individuals exposed to radiation and expands eligibility requirements for compensation to include additional individuals.\n\nSpecifically, the bill extends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Trust Fund until 19 years after this bill's enactment. The trust fund compensates individuals who contract cancer or other diseases as a result of their exposure to radiation during nuclear testing undertaken by the United States during the Cold War.\n\nThe bill revises the requirements governing the compensation of individuals who were exposed to radiation, including by\n\n increasing the amount of compensation that an individual may receive; expanding the affected area to include Colorado, Idaho, Montana, and New Mexico; expanding eligibility requirements to include additional individuals, such as certain employees of uranium mines or mills; and extending until 19 years after this bill's enactment the statute of limitations for the filing of claims. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences must establish a grant program for institutions of higher education to study the epidemiological impacts of uranium mining and milling among non-occupationally exposed individuals.\n\nThe bill expands eligibility requirements for the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program with respect to chronic beryllium disease."
