The bill also increases the annual limit on transfers from $490 million to $750 million.\n\nThe bill also adds miners affected by 2018 coal company bankruptcies to the group whose retiree health benefits are taken into account in determining the amount that Treasury must transfer under current law to the Multiemployer Health Benefit Plan.\n\nAdditionally, the bill (1) allows in-service distributions under a pension plan or governmental section 457(b) plan at age 59-1/2 (currently age 62); and (2) extends and increases the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund excise tax."
