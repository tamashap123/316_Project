    "text": "Protect America's Paper for Recycling Act\n\nThis bill modifies the tax credit for producing electricity from renewable resources to revise the definition of \"municipal solid waste.\"\n\nThe bill specifies that municipal solid waste does not include solid waste collected as part of a system which commingles commonly recycled paper with other solid waste which is not commonly recycled at any point from the time of collection through any materials recovery. The bill includes exceptions for incidental and residual waste.\n\nIn the case of a facility that produces electricity both from municipal solid waste and other solid waste that is not a qualified energy resource (1) the facility is a qualified facility if it otherwise meets the requirements for qualified facilities, and (2) the credit only applies to the portion of the electricity produced from municipal solid waste."
