  <summary date="2019-03-11T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Internet of Things Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019 or the IoT Cybersecurity Improvement Act of 2019

This bill requires the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to take specified steps to increase cybersecurity for Internet of Things (IoT) devices. IoT is the extension of Internet connectivity into physical devices and everyday objects.

The bill establishes September 30, 2019, as the deadline for the completion of NIST's efforts regarding considerations for managing IoT cybersecurity risks, especially regarding examples of possible cybersecurity capabilities of IoT devices. By March 31, 2020, NIST must develop recommendations for the appropriate use and management of IoT devices owned or controlled by the government, including minimum information security requirements for managing cybersecurity risks.

The OMB shall then issue guidelines for each agency that are consistent with such recommendations.

NIST and the OMB shall publish guidance on policies and procedures for the reporting, coordinating, publishing, and receiving of information about a security vulnerability relating to an IoT device used by the government and the resolution of such security vulnerability.</summary>
