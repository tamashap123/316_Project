    "text": "Sixth Amendment Preservation Act\n\nThis bill limits the detention authority of the United States.\n\nCurrent law prohibits the indefinite detention of a U.S. citizen by the United States unless it is authorized by an act of Congress. This bill prohibits the indefinite detention of any person by the United States unless it is consistent with the Constitution.\n\nAdditionally, it specifies that a general authorization to use military force or similar measure, on its own, does not authorize the indefinite detention of a person who is arrested in the United States.\n\nFinally, the bill repeals a provision of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 affirming the authority of the Armed Forces to detain individuals captured in connection with hostilities pursuant to the Authorization for Use of Military Force pending the end of hostilities."
