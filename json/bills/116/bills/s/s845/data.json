(The treaty is set to expire in February 2021 but may be extended to February 2026.)\n\nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence shall report to Congress on (1) Russia's current nuclear forces and predicted force levels in 2026, (2) the impact the New START treaty has had on Russia's nuclear forces and strategic delivery systems, (3) how the expiration of the treaty would affect strategic stability and security for the United States and its allies, and (4) how the expiration of the treaty would affect the ability of the U.S. intelligence community\u00a0to accurately assess Russia's nuclear arsenal.\n\nThe Department of Defense (DOD) shall report to Congress on (1) the impact the expiration of the treaty will have on the U.S. nuclear arsenal and posture, (2) the options available to respond to changes to Russia's nuclear posture if the treaty's limitations are removed, (3) the changes to DOD's budget that will be necessary if the treaty is not extended, and (4) how the expiration of the treaty would affect strategic stability."
