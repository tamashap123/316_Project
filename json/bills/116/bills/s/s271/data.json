Such a child shall be eligible whether he or she remained in the custody of\u00a0 DHS or the Office of Refugee Settlement, was released to a sponsor, or repatriated to his or her country of origin.\n\nIndividuals who are inadmissible for various grounds, including those related to criminal activity or security concerns, shall not be eligible.\n\nThe U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall grant all applications from eligible individuals for humanitarian parole or for lawful permanent resident status, and no application fees may be charged."
