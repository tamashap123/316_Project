This bill instructs the General Services Administration (GSA), the Architect of the Capitol, or any federal agency (other than the Department of Defense) that has independent statutory leasing authority (federal lessee), before entering into a lease agreement or approving a novation agreement with an entity involving a change of ownership under a lease that will be used for high-security leased space, to require the entity to identify the immediate or highest-level owner of the space and disclose whether that owner is a foreign person or entity, including the country associated with the ownership entity.

A federal lessee shall require the entity to (1) provide such identification and disclosure when first submitting a proposal in response to a solicitation for offers issued by the federal lessee; and (2) update such information annually, including the list of the immediate or highest-level owners of that entity or the information required to be provided related to each such owner.

The GSA shall develop a government-wide proposal for identifying all immediate, highest-level, or beneficial owners of high-security leased spaces before entering into a lease agreement to accommodate a federal tenant.

The bill provides a rule for language in a lease agreement (concerning restriction of access to high-security space) between a federal lessee and an entity to accommodate an agency in a building or improvement used for high-security leased space.</summary>
