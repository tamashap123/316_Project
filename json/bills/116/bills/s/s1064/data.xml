This bill directs the Department of Energy to conduct a study on the national security impacts of building ethane and other natural gas liquids petrochemical infrastructure in the vicinity of the Marcellus, Utica, and Rogersville shale plays located in the Appalachian region of the United States.

The study must include an examination of the proposed infrastructure, including an identification of the potential benefits to national and economic security and the risks posed by foreign ownership and control of U.S. domestic petrochemical resources.</summary>
