Such agreement shall require the fund to pay the costs associated with:\n\n conducting a periodic census of, and inspecting the health of, the horses; maintaining records of the horses living in the wild and those living in confinement; conducting the removal and placement of horses and monitoring horses removed from the Currituck County Outer Banks; and administering a viable population-control plan for the horses."
