The State Department shall deny such individuals visas, and the Department of the Treasury shall impose various property-blocking sanctions against listed entities and individuals.\n\nThe State Department shall report to Congress a strategy to promote economic development in Burma.\n\nThe bill also requires reports on\n\n Burma's military, Burma's eligibility for preferential duty treatment, whether certain Burmese military officials should be on the list of specially designated nationals and blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, U.S. diplomatic efforts to impose coordinated sanctions related to Burma, and crimes against humanity in Burma."
