The bill expedites the countervailing duty process (i.e., the imposition of duties to offset a subsidy by a foreign government) for products on such a list.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) repeal certain reduced withholding rates for residents of China, and (2) tax income received by China from certain U.S. investments."
