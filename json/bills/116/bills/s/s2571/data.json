A \"qualified manufactured home community cooperative or corporation\" is a cooperative or a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the laws of the state in which the property is located.\n\nThe bill specifies membership and governance requirements for the communities owned by the cooperative or nonprofit corporation. The bill also imposes a tax on buyers who violate the covenant to use the property for manufactured housing."
