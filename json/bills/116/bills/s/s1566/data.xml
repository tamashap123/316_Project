This bill requires military departments to provide members of the Armed Forces with a federal write-in absentee ballot together with instructions on the appropriate use of the ballot with respect to the state in which the member is registered to vote. Members intending to vote in a state that does not accept the federal write-in absentee ballot as a simultaneous application and acceptable ballot for federal elections must be provided a briefing on, and an opportunity to fill out, the official post card form for absentee voter registration application and absentee ballot application.</summary>
