This bill repeals the rules for peanuts under the nonrecourse marketing assistance loan program administered by the Department of Agriculture (USDA). (Under a nonrecourse marketing assistance loan, a farmer pledges a commodity as collateral and may deliver the pledged collateral to USDA to repay the loan.)

The bill also prohibits federal funds from being used for the development of (1) a beerbot or other robot bartender; or (2) insect-based foods for human consumption, including cricket farming and taste-testing of insect-based foods.</summary>
