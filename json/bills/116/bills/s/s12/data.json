The bill also: (1) exempts HSAs from creditor claims in bankruptcy, and (2) reauthorizes Medicaid health opportunity accounts.\n\nThe bill allows a medical care tax deduction for: (1) exercise equipment, physical fitness programs, and membership at a fitness facility; (2) nutritional and dietary supplements; and (3) periodic fees paid to a primary care physician and amounts paid for pre-paid primary care services."
