    "text": "Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act of 2019\n\nThis bill expands sanctions and reporting requirements related to North Korea and revises provisions related to combating human trafficking.\n\nThe Department of the Treasury shall impose asset-related sanctions on persons that\u00a0knowingly provide significant financial services to any person that\u00a0is subject to various sanctions, including those covered in any United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution.\n\nThe President may impose sanctions on persons that take certain actions related to North Korea, including knowingly (1) engaging in transactions in goods such as coal, or (2) contributing to a violation of a UNSC resolution through a significant transfer of property.\n\nA country that has transacted in defense articles with North Korea shall be barred from receiving certain U.S. assistance for five years, whereas currently the prohibition lasts for two years.\n\nThe President's annual report to Congress on the implementation of UNSC resolutions shall include information on countries that fail to prohibit certain activities related to North Korea, such as the unauthorized clearing of funds. The bill also imposes various reporting requirements, such as\u00a0requirements for Treasury to report on\u00a0how North Korea's government exploits beneficial ownership rules to access the international financial system.\n\nThe bill authorizes each state to adopt measures to require the divestment of the state's assets from North Korea-related investments.\n\nTreasury shall designate an office to coordinate efforts to combat the illicit financing of human trafficking. The Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking shall report to Congress recommendations for strengthening anti-money-laundering efforts in relation to human trafficking."
