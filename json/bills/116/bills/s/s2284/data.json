    "text": "Climate Action Rebate Act of 2019\n\nThis bill imposes a carbon fee on the use, sale, or transfer of certain fossil fuels and fluorinated gases\u00a0that emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The\u00a0fee is imposed on producers and importers of such fuels and is deposited into a Climate Action Rebate Fund established by this bill.\u00a0\n\nThe bill\u00a0establishes an gradual emissions reduction schedule for such fuels between 2020\u00a0and 2050 (100% reduction).\n\nThe bill requires payment of an equalization fee\u00a0by fossil fuels and carbon-intensive imported goods at the border and provides for refunds of comparable exports.\n\nThe bill rebates up to 70% of net revenues from the fund\u00a0to low-income individuals as a monthly dividend. Remaining revenues\u00a0must be used\u00a0for investment in infrastructure, energy innovation, and assistance for workers and communities to transition to a cleaner energy economy.\n\nAll carbon fee revenue must be spent in accordance with Buy American requirements and the Davis-Bacon Act (requires payment of local prevailing wage on public works projects for laborers and mechanics),"
