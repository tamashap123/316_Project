The President shall direct U.S. representatives to the United Nations to prioritize U.N. efforts to provide humanitarian aid to Venezuela.\n\nThe bill imposes sanctions on foreign persons responsible for or complicit in corruption or activity undermining Venezuela's democratic institutions. Sanctions include barring entry into the United States and various financial restrictions.\n\nThe bill also imposes various sanctions targeting the Maduro regime's ability to finance debt, trade gold, and use cryptocurrencies to evade U.S. sanctions.\n\nThe bill establishes a special envoy and task force for Venezuela to coordinate and oversee U.S. efforts regarding Venezuela.\n\nThe bill directs the State Department to\n\n work with nongovernmental organizations to strengthen democratic governance and defend human rights in Venezuela, investigate corruption and recover assets stolen from Venezuela, help other countries establish legislative frameworks to impose sanctions on Maduro regime officials. The President shall engage with multilateral development banks to assist in rebuilding Venezuela's economy and energy infrastructure.\n\nThe bill directs the President to prevent Russia's government-controlled oil company Rosneft from acquiring control of critical U.S. energy infrastructure, including assets belonging to Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A."
