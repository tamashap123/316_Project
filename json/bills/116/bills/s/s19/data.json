The bill excludes premiums paid by residents of U.S. territories from a health insurer's net premiums, but still includes the premiums of such residents in the determination of total premiums from the preceding year, thereby lowering the fee for these insurers.\n\nUnder current law, the fee is suspended for calendar 2019 (i.e., there is no fee based on premiums from calendar 2018)."
