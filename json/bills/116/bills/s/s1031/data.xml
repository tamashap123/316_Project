This bill directs the U.S. Coast Guard to implement regulations related to the safety of amphibious passenger vessels, including during severe weather emergencies.

Operators of amphibious passenger vessels are required to provide reserve buoyancy for such vessels through passive means, including watertight compartmentalization, built-in flotation, or other means, to ensure that such vessels remain afloat and upright in the event of flooding, including when carrying a full complement of passengers and crew.

The bill sets forth requirements for vessels that are not in compliance with the regulations.</summary>
