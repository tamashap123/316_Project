Specifically, this requirement shall not apply with respect to an audit report prepared for an issuer that\n\n ceased to be an emerging growth company on the last day of its fiscal year following the five-year period beginning on the date of its first sale of common equity securities, had average annual gross revenues of less than $50 million as of its most recently completed fiscal year, and is not a large accelerated filer. An issuer shall\u00a0cease to be eligible for the\u00a0exemption at the earliest of (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the\u00a010-year period beginning on the date of its\u00a0first sale of common equity securities, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which its average annual gross revenues exceed $50 million, or (3) when the issuer becomes a large accelerated filer."
