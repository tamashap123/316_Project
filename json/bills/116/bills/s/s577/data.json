Such an exclusion must be based on a determination that the article can easily be excluded by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and that\u00a0(1) the article is not commercially available outside of China or produced at a cost-competitive price, (2) a duty on the article would increase consumer prices for everyday items consumed by low- or middle-income families in the United States, or (3) the article does not directly benefit from nonmarket-based policies of China.\n\nFurther, this exclusion applies retroactively to recently imported articles that would have been subject to a lower rate under this bill."
