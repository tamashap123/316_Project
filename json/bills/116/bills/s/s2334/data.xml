This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a 21st Century Energy Workforce Advisory Board to develop a strategy for the support and development of a skilled energy workforce.

Based on the board's recommendations, DOE shall establish a clearinghouse to:

 maintain and update information and resources on training and workforce development programs for energy- and manufacturing-related jobs; and act as a resource and provide guidance for secondary schools, institutions of higher education (including community colleges and minority-serving institutions), and workforce development, labor management, and industry organizations that would like to develop and implement energy- and manufacturing-related training programs. DOE shall also establish a pilot program to award grants to eligible entities for job training programs that lead to an industry-recognized credential.</summary>
