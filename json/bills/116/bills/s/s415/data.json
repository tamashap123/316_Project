An abused individual with immigrant status shall receive employment authorization, be eligible for renewal or extension of status, and become an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under certain conditions.\n\nCurrently, the VAWA provides a path to immigrant status to abused individuals who derive their status from a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, but not to those covered under this bill."
