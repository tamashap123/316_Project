This bill allows an abused spouse or child whose immigrant status is derived from another alien (the principal alien) to obtain immigrant status independent of the principal alien under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA).

Such an abused spouse or child must be accompanying or following to join the principal alien, and have been subject to battery or extreme cruelty by the principal alien. An abused individual with immigrant status shall receive employment authorization, be eligible for renewal or extension of status, and become an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence under certain conditions.

Currently, the VAWA provides a path to immigrant status to abused individuals who derive their status from a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident, but not to those covered under this bill.</summary>
