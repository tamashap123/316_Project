Each report shall discuss specific countries of concern and contain a plan for engaging with countries to increase cooperation with respect to Taiwan. (Taiwan is self-governing, but China considers it a renegade province and has taken actions to encourage countries and international organizations to limit or cut off relations with Taiwan.)\n\nThe bill authorizes the State Department to take various actions in response to nations acting to undermine Taiwan,\u00a0including adjusting U.S. diplomatic presence or the level of U.S. assistance in such countries. The State Department shall consult with Congress before taking such actions."
