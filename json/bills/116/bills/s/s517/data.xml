This bill establishes tiered hiring preferences for members of the reserve components of the Armed Forces.

The bill grants (1) a 2-point preference to current members of a reserve component who have completed at least 6 years of service in a reserve component and were credited with at least 50 retirement points in each year of service, and (2) a 3-point preference to current members of a reserve component who have completed a least 10 years of service and were credited with at least 50 retirement points in each year of service.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on federal employment opportunities for members of a reserve component and the impact of this bill on the hiring of reservists and veterans by the federal government.</summary>
