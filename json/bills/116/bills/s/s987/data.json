The bill also calls for annual reports on\n\n supply chain risks associated with China, in particular involving communications and mobile technologies and equipment; and CCP influence and propaganda activities in the United States. The bill also establishes that informational materials that must be labeled as distributed by a foreign principal shall be labeled as such on the first page in the languages used in the document."
