    "text": "Syrian Allies Protection Act\n\nThis bill authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide certain Syrian nationals with special immigrant status.\n\nTo qualify, a Syrian national must (1) have worked directly with the Armed Forces in a role that was vital to the success of the U.S. military mission in Syria for at least six months during a specified time period, (2) have a favorable written recommendation from a general or flag officer in the chain of command of the unit that the alien was supporting, and (3) pass a background check. The spouse or child of a qualifying alien shall also qualify if accompanying the qualifying alien.\n\nTo receive special immigrant status, a qualified alien must apply to DHS and be otherwise eligible for an immigrant visa and admissible for permanent residence, except that an alien shall not be inadmissible on the grounds that the alien will likely become a public charge. Aliens granted special immigrant status under this bill shall qualify for benefits available to refugees for six months. Up to 250 principal aliens may receive special immigrant status each fiscal year under this bill.\n\nFor applicants whose lives are at risk while awaiting background checks, the Department of Defense shall implement a framework to temporarily resettle such applicants in a safe third country or grant them humanitarian parole.\n\nDHS may provide lawful permanent resident status to an alien paroled or admitted as a nonimmigrant and who otherwise qualifies for special immigrant status under this bill."
