  <summary date="2019-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Countering the Chinese Government and Communist Party's Political Influence Operations Act

This bill directs the Department of State and the Department of Homeland Security to devise a long-term strategy to counter the Chinese government's political influence operations.

The strategy shall seek to counter the ruling Chinese Communist Party's campaigns to corrupt democratic countries and undermine democratic institutions, both in the United States and elsewhere. It shall also seek to increase awareness of such campaigns and help other countries develop the capacity to counter them.

The strategy shall also ensure that Chinese nationals living in the United States, as well as Chinese Americans and members of the Uyghur and Tibetan diaspora, are protected against malign political influence operations, such as surveillance and intimidation.

The State Department shall also report to Congress about Chinese government efforts to exert influence in the United States and in U.S. partner countries, and suggestions for countering such efforts. The report shall address issues including attempts to (1) influence government institutions and officials, (2) undermine democratic institutions and freedom of speech, and (3) suppress public information.</summary>
