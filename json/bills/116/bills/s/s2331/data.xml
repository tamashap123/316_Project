This bill adds requirements regarding the availability of training that the Department of Agriculture provides under current law for local food service personnel in schools.

The training must be scheduled primarily during regular, paid working hours; provided at no cost to food service personnel; offered in-person whenever appropriate; and incorporate hands-on training techniques.

If the training is scheduled outside of working hours, food service personnel must be informed about the necessity of scheduling the program, consulted to schedule the program, and compensated for attending the program. Personnel may not be penalized for failing to attend a program outside of working hours.</summary>
