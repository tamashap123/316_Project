This bill establishes new criminal offenses related to the transportation of a minor across state lines for an abortion.

Specifically, the bill makes it a crime to knowingly transport a minor across a state line to obtain an abortion without satisfying a parental involvement law in the minor's resident state. A parental involvement law requires parental consent or notification, or judicial authorization, for a minor to obtain an abortion.

A violator is subject to criminal penalties&#8212;a fine, up to one year in prison, or both. The bill provides an exception for an abortion that is necessary to save the life of a minor whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or condition.

Additionally, the bill prohibits and imposes criminal penalties on an individual who commits incest with a minor and knowingly transports the minor across a state line to receive an abortion.</summary>
