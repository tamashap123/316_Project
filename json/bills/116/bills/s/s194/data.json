A parental involvement law requires parental consent or notification, or judicial authorization, for a minor to obtain an abortion.\n\nA violator is subject to criminal penalties\u2014a fine, up to one year in prison, or both. The bill provides an exception for an abortion that is necessary to save the life of a minor whose life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or condition.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits and imposes criminal penalties on an individual who commits incest with a minor and knowingly transports the minor across a state line to receive an abortion."
