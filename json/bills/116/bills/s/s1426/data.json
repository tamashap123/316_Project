Interior must publish the complaint in a citizen suit within 30 days of being served. Affected parties must be given a reasonable opportunity to intervene in the suit. If affected parties intervene, the court must refer the action to a mediation program or magistrate judge to facilitate settlement discussions.\n\nThe court is prohibited from awarding litigation costs in\u00a0such citizen suits that are\u00a0settled.\n\nInterior must provide notice of a proposed settlement to each affected\u00a0state or county. A settlement may not be approved if states or counties object."
