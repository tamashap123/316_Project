This bill directs the Department of the Interior to publish, and update every two years, an Asset Management Report. The report must describe the Bureau of Reclamation's efforts to (1) maintain in a reliable manner its reserved works (e.g., buildings, structures, facilities, or equipment); and (2) standardize and streamline data reporting and processes across regions and areas for the purpose of maintaining reserved works. The report must include (1) an assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for reserved works, and (2) an itemized and prioritized list of major repair and rehabilitation needs of individual facilities.

Interior must coordinate with the nonfederal entities responsible for the operation and maintenance of Reclamation facilities, known as transferred works, in developing reporting requirements for their major repair and rehabilitation needs.</summary>
