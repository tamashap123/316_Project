The report must include (1) an assessment of major repair and rehabilitation needs for reserved works, and (2) an itemized and prioritized list of major repair and rehabilitation needs of individual facilities.\n\nInterior must coordinate with the nonfederal entities responsible for the operation and maintenance of Reclamation facilities, known as transferred works, in developing reporting requirements for their major repair and rehabilitation needs."
