This bill directs the Department of State to develop a strategy to enhance economic cooperation and expand professional and educational exchange programs between the United States and Mexico.

The State Department shall develop strategies to encourage more academic exchanges between the countries, as well as exchanges to encourage strengthening business skills and entrepreneurship.

The State Department shall also promote energy infrastructure coordination and educational development. It shall also assess ways to develop partnerships between the countries' medical and nursing schools. The plan should ensure that accreditation standards for such schools are comparable so that students in Mexico can pass the licensing exams needed to practice in the United States.

These programs shall be focused on the region within 100 kilometers of the U.S.-Mexico border.</summary>
