This bill directs the Department of Energy (DOE) to establish a program for the capture of carbon dioxide produced during the generation of natural gas-generated power.

Specifically, DOE must

 identify opportunities to accelerate the development of commercially viable carbon capture technologies to reduce carbon dioxide emissions; enter into cooperative agreements with certain entities to license, permit, construct, and operate at least three facilities to capture carbon dioxide from natural gas generating power facilities; and identify any barriers to the commercial development of carbon capture technologies.</summary>
