    "text": "Creating Transparency to Have Drug Rebates Unlocked (C-THRU) Act of 2019\n\nThis bill establishes a series of requirements relating to drug rebates and discounts under Medicare and Medicare Advantage (MA).\n\n Specifically, for each pharmacy benefits manager (PBM) that contracts with a prescription drug\u00a0plan (PDP) under Medicare or\u00a0MA,\u00a0or with a qualified health benefits plan offered through a health insurance exchange,\u00a0HHS must publish on its website (1) the amount and type of rebates and discounts negotiated by the PBM and the extent to which these rebates and discounts are passed on to the plan sponsor, and (2) the difference between the amount paid by the plan sponsor to the PBM and the amount paid by the PBM to pharmacies.\n\nAs a condition of participation as a contractor\u00a0under Medicare or MA, a PBM must pass\u00a0on to\u00a0a\u00a0PDP sponsor a minimum percentage, as established by HHS, of the amount of rebates and discounts negotiated by the PBM that are attributable to patient utilization under the plan.\n\nThe bill also\u00a0modifies requirements\u00a0regarding Medicare enrollees' access to negotiated drug prices.\u00a0Current law requires\u00a0a PDP sponsor\u00a0to provide enrollees in Medicare\u00a0or MA\u00a0with access to negotiated\u00a0drug prices that\u00a0account for rebates and discounts. The bill requires\u00a0that, with respect to a covered drug,\u00a0a\u00a0negotiated price (or,\u00a0if necessary, an approximate negotiated price)\u00a0be provided at the point of sale."
