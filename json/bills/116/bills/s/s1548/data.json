A \"labor lockout\" is a dispute involving a work stoppage, wherein an employer withholds work from its employees in order to gain a concession from them.\n\nThe bill also denies certain tax deductions and credits for remuneration (including wages or other benefits) paid by the taxpayer to a temporary replacement worker during a labor lockout."
