USDA\u00a0may implement such alternatives, as limited by the bill, as well as\u00a0further test them in demonstration projects.\n\nThe bill also requires USDA to\u00a0increase the amount of administrative funds paid to an Indian tribe that agrees to assume responsibility for the administration of one of the specified food programs."
