The State Department shall report to Congress if it learns of facts that contradict a certification made in the last three years.\n\nThe President may waive the certification requirement for national security purposes, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution prohibiting the transaction.\n\nThe State Department shall report to Congress a strategy to ensure human rights protections for U.S. military assistance and arms transfers.\n\nThe bill expands an existing monitoring program to include monitoring to ensure that arms and services exported as foreign assistance are not being used by non-state actors and proxies for committing gross human rights abuses."
