This bill prohibits a large social media company from moderating information on its platform from a politically biased standpoint.

Under current law, a social media company is generally immune from liability with respect to content posted on its platform by users and other content providers. However, the bill removes this statutory immunity unless the social media company obtains certification from the Federal Trade Commission that it does not moderate information on its platform in a manner that is biased against a political party, candidate, or viewpoint.</summary>
