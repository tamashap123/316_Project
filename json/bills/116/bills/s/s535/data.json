    "text": "Protect Federal Workers' Credit Act \n\nThis bill generally restricts the inclusion of certain negative credit information on credit reports upon notification that an individual was affected by a federal government shutdown. Specifically, the bill prohibits (1) an individual from reporting such negative credit information to a consumer reporting agency and (2) the inclusion of such negative credit information on a credit report. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau must maintain a database of affected federal employees and contractors and make the database accessible to consumer reporting agencies. Subsequently, consumer reporting agencies must delete all negative credit information from the relevant time period regarding affected federal employees and contractors. Consumer reporting agencies must also make additional free credit reports available to an affected individual upon request."
