This bill modifies the requirements for calculating taxable income to exclude from gross income any earthquake loss mitigation received by a residential property owner or occupant under a state-based earthquake loss mitigation program.

"Earthquake loss mitigation" is any property or service that reduces seismic risks to a residential structure or its contents. The term includes any payment, reimbursement, loan, loan forgiveness, grant, credit, rebate, voucher, or other financial incentive for the property or service.

The bill applies to earthquake loss mitigation programs established by a state (including an agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision of the state) or by a state with a tax-exempt organization or public instrumentality of the state.</summary>
