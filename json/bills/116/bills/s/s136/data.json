Such programs shall provide employment services, training, and related services.\n\nThe bill also establishes criteria for using such funds for various purposes, including subsidized jobs. The bill also establishes various reporting and application requirements for\u00a0states seeking funds for such programs.\n\nThe bill establishes an assistance program for self-employed individuals who meet various requirements and whose most recent contracts ended through no fault of their\u00a0own. Such\u00a0individuals shall be entitled to a weekly benefit equal to half of the average weekly earnings from their\u00a0last employment, not to exceed the maximum available for unemployment benefits. An individual may not concurrently receive unemployment compensation and self-employment assistance.\n\nDislocated workers and long-term unemployed individuals shall be entitled to assistance for moving to a new area to earn family-sustaining employment. Such assistance may cover up to 90% of reasonable expenses, subject to a cap of $2,000 for an individual.\n\nThe bill establishes the Office of Reemployment Assistance in the Social Security Administration to administer the self-employment and relocation assistance programs."
