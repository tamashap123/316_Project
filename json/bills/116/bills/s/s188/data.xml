This bill allocates funds from certain duties imposed on Chinese goods toward the construction of physical barriers and roads along the southwest border of the United States. Such funds shall be equivalent to 50% of certain duties imposed in response to Chinese actions that violate a trade agreement or impose an unjustifiable restriction on U.S. commerce. The funds shall be available to the Department of Homeland Security for such border construction without further appropriation.</summary>
