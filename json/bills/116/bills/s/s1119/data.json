The child also may not be required to (1) perform chores or activities that are not required of students generally, or (2) dispose of food after it has been served to the child.\n\nAny communication related to outstanding credit must be directed to the child's parent or guardian. A child may be required to deliver a letter regarding outstanding credit that is addressed to a parent or guardian if the letter is not distributed to the child in a manner that stigmatizes the child.\n\nThe bill also expresses the sense of Congress regarding several issues regarding the administration of the school meal programs."
