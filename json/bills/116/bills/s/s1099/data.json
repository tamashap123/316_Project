The IRS may apply to a court for one 30-day extension of the notice requirement if it can establish probable cause of an imminent threat to national security or personal safety.\n\nIf the owner requests a court hearing within 30 days after notice is provided, the property must be returned unless the court holds a hearing within 30 days after notice is provided and finds that there is probable cause to believe that the property was derived from an illegal source or the funds were structured to conceal the violation of a criminal law or regulation other than a structuring violation.\n\nFor tax purposes, the bill excludes from gross income any interest received from the federal government with respect to an action to recover property seized by the IRS pursuant to a claimed violation of the structuring provisions of the BSA."
