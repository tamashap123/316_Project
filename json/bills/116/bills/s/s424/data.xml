This bill modifies enforcement authorities of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).

It modifies the required elements of an order to show cause issued by the DEA before it denies, revokes, or suspends a registration for a CSA violation. Specifically, the bill eliminates the requirement for an order to show cause to notify the registrant of the opportunity to submit a corrective action plan.

Additionally, the bill modifies the standard of review for an immediate suspension order. Currently, the DEA may immediately suspend the registration of a controlled substances manufacturer, distributor, or dispenser to prevent imminent danger to the public health and safety. This bill lowers the standard for determining imminent danger to the public health and safety&#8212;from substantial likelihood of an immediate threat of harm to probable cause that harm will occur.</summary>
