This bill modifies the requirements for calculating taxable income to exclude from gross income payments received under the federally funded student loan repayment program for full-time faculty members of dental schools with programs in general, pediatric, or public health dentistry.

The bill also requires the Government Accountability Office to report to Congress on the participation of dental providers and faculty in areas and schools receiving funding under the program.</summary>
