  <summary date="2019-04-04T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">Cell-Cultured Meat and Poultry Regulation Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enter into a binding formal agreement regarding the authority of each agency to oversee cell-cultured meat and poultry.

The agreement must require the FDA to (1) oversee cell collection, cell banks, and cell growth and differentiation; and (2) transition oversight authority of food products at the beginning of the cell harvest stage to USDA. After the transition, USDA must oversee the processing, preparation, packaging, and labeling of the food products.</summary>
