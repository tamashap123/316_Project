This bill requires the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy to act as the lead federal agency for coordinating and disseminating information on existing federal programs that support energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy retrofitting projects for schools. The bill also outlines the requirements for such coordination and outreach.

Specifically, the office must:

 review such programs and financing mechanisms for such projects; establish a federal cross-departmental collaborative coordination, education, and outreach effort to communicate about such programs; provide technical assistance for states, local educational agencies, and schools to help develop and finance projects; develop and maintain a single online resource website with contact information for relevant technical assistance and support staff in the office; and establish a process to recognize schools that have successfully implemented such projects.</summary>
