The bill also outlines the requirements for such coordination and outreach.\n\nSpecifically, the office must:\n\n review such programs and financing mechanisms for such projects; establish a federal cross-departmental collaborative coordination, education, and outreach effort to communicate about such programs; provide technical assistance for states, local educational agencies, and schools to help develop and finance projects; develop and maintain a single online resource website with contact information for relevant technical assistance and support staff in the office; and establish a process to recognize schools that have successfully implemented such projects."
