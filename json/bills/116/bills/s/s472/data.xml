This bill repeals the requirement that a portion of aviation security service fees collected from passengers be credited as offsetting receipts and deposited in the general fund of the Treasury and instead requires such fees to be deposited into a separate account in the Treasury for expenditure only to pay the costs of activities and services for which the fee is imposed.</summary>
