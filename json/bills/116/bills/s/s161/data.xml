  <summary date="2019-01-16T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in Senate">This bill requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Congress on the filing requirements for telecommunications carriers or service providers that receive Universal Service Fund program support to provide service to qualifying low-income consumers, rural or high-cost areas, rural health care providers, schools, or libraries. The report must analyze the financial impact of those filing requirements and provide any recommendations on how to consolidate redundant filing requirements.

After receiving the GAO report, the FCC must initiate a rulemaking to consolidate redundant filing requirements and incorporate any of the reported recommendations.</summary>
