In developing these rate maps, FEMA must use the most current remote sensing technology.\n\nIn coordination with the Technical Mapping Advisory Council, FEMA must establish a digital database to display the flood hazard risks of buildings in NFIP. The database must contain specified information about each property, including a certification of the building's elevation. FEMA must provide a one-time premium credit for the purchase of an elevation certificate by a policyholder.\n\nThe bill allows reimbursement to local governments that assist FEMA in developing flood risk zone data."
