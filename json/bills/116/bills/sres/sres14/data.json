The resolution also urges the Department of State to downgrade Cuba to Tier 3 in its annual Trafficking in Persons report and to reestablish the Cuban Medical Professionals Parole program, which allowed certain Cuban medical personnel in countries other than Cuba to apply for parole to enter the United States."
