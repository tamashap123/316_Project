  <summary date="2019-03-07T14:21:49Z" status="Passed House">This resolution rejects the perpetuation of anti-Semitic stereotypes in the United States and around the world, and condemns anti-Semitic acts and statements. The resolution reaffirms support for the mandate of the United States Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism. Additionally, the resolution rejects attempts to justify hatred or violent attacks over political frustrations. Law enforcement is encouraged to avoid conduct that raises the specter of unconstitutional profiling against anyone because of their race, religion, nationality, politics, or social group.

This resolution also acknowledges the harm suffered by Muslims from harassment, discrimination, and violence and condemns anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against all minorities.

Finally, the resolution condemns death threats received by Jewish and Muslim Members of Congress.</summary>
