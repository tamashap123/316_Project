Law enforcement is encouraged to avoid conduct that raises the specter of unconstitutional profiling against anyone because of their race, religion, nationality, politics, or social group.\n\nThis resolution also acknowledges the harm suffered by Muslims from harassment, discrimination, and violence and condemns anti-Muslim discrimination and bigotry against all minorities.\n\nFinally, the resolution condemns death threats received by Jewish and Muslim Members of Congress."
