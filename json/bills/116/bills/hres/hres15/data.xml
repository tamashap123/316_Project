  <summary date="2019-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses support for the intelligence community's assessment that Russian agents acting under the direction of Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered with the 2016 presidential election. It also expresses strong disapproval of the President's failure to support that assessement.

 The resolution also expresses opposition to any future secret meetings between the President and Putin, and calls upon the President to submit any agreement reached with Putin in Helsinki to Congress for approval.</summary>
