  <summary date="2019-01-17T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution affirms the House of Representatives' obligation to fulfill the promises made to senior citizens of the United States regarding access to Medicare and Social Security.

It also rejects any changes to Medicare or Social Security that diminish benefits for Americans currently enrolled, or soon to be enrolled, in the Medicare program or the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program.

The resolution also expresses the House's commitment that these programs should be strengthened and preserved, and expresses support for efforts to reduce waste, fraud, and abuse in these programs.</summary>
