  <summary date="2019-02-13T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that:

 the trial and conviction of 50 African-American sailors for mutiny in connection with their service at the Port Chicago Naval Magazine in Concord, California, during World War II were wrongfully pursued because of racial prejudice; and Congress should publicly exonerate the 50 sailors to further aid in healing the racial divide that continues to exist in the United States.</summary>
