  <summary date="2019-01-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution expresses the sense of the House of Representatives with respect to Holocaust education.

Specifically, it (1) commends Holocaust education activists on their efforts to include Holocaust education in states' public school curricula, (2) urges more states and school districts to include Holocaust education in their curricula, and (3) expresses the sense of the House that more should be done to instill in the nation's schools the promise that we will never forget the horrors of the Holocaust and must always work to prevent such atrocities from occurring in the future.</summary>
