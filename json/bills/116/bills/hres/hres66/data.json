It resolves that oversight hearings will be held to ensure the agencies are enforcing title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its implementing regulations, including enforcement with respect to unintentional discrimination.\n\nFinally, the resolution states that the House will consider legislation that reaffirms the original intent of the Civil Rights Act of 1964."
