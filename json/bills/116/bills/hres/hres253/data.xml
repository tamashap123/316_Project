  <summary date="2019-03-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This resolution declares that socialism (1) along with Marxism, is a failed ideology; (2) poses a significant threat to the freedom, liberty, and economic prosperity to all countries and citizens around the world; and (3) is a failed experiment of governance that inevitably ends in suffering.

The resolution affirms that America will never be a socialist nation.</summary>
