In addition, this resolution encourages

 state and local governments and the Environmental Protection Agency to set standards for hexavalent chromium in drinking water, consideration of a tax break for purchase of a filtration system to mitigate the effects of hexavalent chromium, and government agencies to determine the causes of harmful levels of hexavalent chromium and take appropriate mitigation actions.</summary>
