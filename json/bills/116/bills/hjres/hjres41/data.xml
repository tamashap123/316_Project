No funds shall be authorized or appropriated to support any efforts to withdraw from the treaty without the Senate's approval by a two-thirds vote or an act of Congress.

The President shall notify Congress in writing of any effort to suspend or withdraw from the treaty no later than 48 hours after such action.

This joint resolution also authorizes the Senate Legal Counsel and the General Counsel of the House of Representatives to represent Congress in judicial proceedings related to actions that are inconsistent with this resolution.</summary>
