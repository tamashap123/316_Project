Additionally, the CR has the effect of extending through February 1, 2019, several authorities and programs that were extended in prior CRs, including\n\n the Violence Against Women Act, the authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to collect and spend certain fees related to pesticides, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and several authorities related to immigration."
