The statement of intent must include a detailed explanation of\n\n proposals of the President to reduce the debt; the impact the increased debt limit will have on future government spending, debt service, and the position of the U.S. dollar as the international reserve currency; and projections of the fiscal health and sustainability of major entitlement programs (including Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid). Treasury must make the information required by this bill available to the public on its website.\n\nUpon request, Treasury must submit to Congress specified financial and economic data relevant to determining the amount of the public debt."
