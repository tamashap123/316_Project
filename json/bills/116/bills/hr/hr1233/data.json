DHS shall not take actions toward construction of such barriers or roads until the fund is made available to eligible property owners and such owners are informed as to how to access support through the fund.\n\nAssistance through the fund shall be limited to low-income property owners or those who lack adequate resources to secure representation against the government, as determined by DHS."
