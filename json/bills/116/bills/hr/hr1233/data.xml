  <summary date="2019-02-14T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Borderland Takings Defense Fund Act

This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to establish a fund to assist eligible individuals when the government seeks to acquire or condemn such individuals' property for the purpose of building physical barriers or roads along the U.S.-Mexico border. DHS shall not take actions toward construction of such barriers or roads until the fund is made available to eligible property owners and such owners are informed as to how to access support through the fund.

Assistance through the fund shall be limited to low-income property owners or those who lack adequate resources to secure representation against the government, as determined by DHS.</summary>
