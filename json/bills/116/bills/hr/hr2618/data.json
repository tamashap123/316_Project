The spouse may elect to use the same residence as the member regardless of the date of marriage.\n\nThe bill authorizes the Department of Defense to enter into an agreement with the Council of State Governments to assist with funding for interstate compacts on licensed occupations in order to alleviate burdens associated with relicensing when members make a permanent change of duty station to another state."
