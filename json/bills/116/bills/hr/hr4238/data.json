The credit is available for no more than two taxable years with respect to any apprenticeship employee.\n\nAn apprenticeship employee is any employee who is employed by an employer in an officially recognized apprenticeable occupation and pursuant to an apprentice agreement registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency.\n\nAs an offset to the cost of this bill, the Office of Management and Budget shall coordinate with federal department heads and independent agencies to impose limits on government printing costs."
