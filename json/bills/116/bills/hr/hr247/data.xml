The office shall be headed by a Federal Chief Information Officer who shall report directly to the Director of OMB (currently, the head of E-Gov reports to the Deputy Director). There is established in the office a Federal Chief Information Security Officer.

Agencies must report IT expenditures to the Federal CIO. The Federal CIO must publish timely, searchable, computer-readable data on agency IT expenditures, projects, and programs.
