The USGS may provide grants to research, map, assess, and collect data on landslide hazards.\n\nThe National Science Foundation may provide grants to eligible entities for landslide research.\n\nThe USGS (1) shall advance the identification, mapping, research, monitoring, restoration, and mitigation of subsidence and groundwater resource accounting, losses from subsidence, including saltwater intrusion, particularly in areas affected by drought and sea level rise; (2) shall establish the 3D Elevation Program and the 3D Elevation Federal Interagency Coordinating Committee; and (3) may make grants and enter into cooperative agreements to facilitate the improvement of nationwide coverage of 3D elevation data."
