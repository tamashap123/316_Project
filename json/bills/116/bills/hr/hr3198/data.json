Specifically, the review must be completed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the National Credit Union Administration, in addition to (as required under current law) the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board. The review must be performed at least every 7, rather than 10,\u00a0years.\n\nAfter performing the review, a regulator must consider\u00a0tailoring regulations to limit\u00a0specified burdens.\n\nThe bill specifies information and criteria the CFPB must use when conducting its review."
