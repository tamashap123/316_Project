NOAA must prioritize projects that (1) address ecosystems and communities vulnerable to the impacts of ocean acidification, (2) demonstrate support from local stakeholders, or (3) utilize seafood industry assets as research and monitoring platforms.\n\nNOAA may provide grants to a partnership in which a marine-dependent industry is substituted for the seafood industry."
