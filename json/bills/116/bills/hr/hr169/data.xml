This bill amends the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) to increase authorization levels for FY2019-FY2020.

The bill decreases the allocation of funds under national priority safety programs for (1) occupant protection, (2) state traffic safety information system improvements, and (3) impaired driving countermeasures.

The Department of Transportation must award grants to states that enact a commuter safety education program for educational and training programs concerning law enforcement practices during traffic stops and other in-person encounters.

In each fiscal year, 2% of the funds provided for commuter safety education shall be allocated among states that implement commuter safety education programs.</summary>
