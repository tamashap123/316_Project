(Under current law, the prohibition applies only to sales of tangible personal property.)\n\nThe bill also (1) prohibits state taxation of an out-of-state entity unless the entity has a physical presence in the taxing state, (2) sets forth criteria for determining physical presence in a state, and (3) specifies requirements for computing the tax liability of affiliated businesses operating in a state."
