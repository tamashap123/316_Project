The court must render judgement without regard to defenses based on the passage of time, including the statute of limitations. The United States is the only entity liable for such a claim, and monetary damages are the only available remedy. This jurisdiction expires unless such a claim is filed within one year.\n\nAll other claims of the tribe, including claims to title arising under the Treaty of Grouseland and the Northwest Ordinance, are extinguished."
