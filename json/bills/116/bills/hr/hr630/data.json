DHS may provide equipment, training, and maintenance services related to such systems. DHS shall notify Congress when it provides such equipment to a foreign government, along with information such as the specific risk that will be mitigated by the system and the total dollar value of the equipment provided.\n\nThe bill directs the State Department to report to Congress each year on countries that fail to meet minimum standards to combat terrorist and foreign fighter travel. The State Department is authorized to suspend certain foreign assistance to countries that do not make significant efforts to meet such standards."
