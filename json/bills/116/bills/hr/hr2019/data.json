Under the program, DOE must award grants to water authorities\u00a0(i.e., authorities that provide water, wastewater, or water reuse services)\u00a0for demonstrating advanced and innovative technology-based solutions that will\n\n increase and improve\u00a0the energy efficiency of water, wastewater, and water reuse systems; support the implementation of innovative processes and the installation of advanced automated systems that provide real-time data on energy and water; and improve energy and water conservation, water quality, and predictive maintenance of energy and water systems, through the use of Internet-connected technologies."
