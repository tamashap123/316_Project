  <summary date="2019-05-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Physical Activities Recommendations for Americans Act of 2019

This bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to publish a report at least every 10 years that contains physical activity recommendations for the general public based on the most current scientific and medical knowledge, including information for population subgroups, as needed.

HHS must publish updated reports that detail evidence-based practices and highlight continuing physical activity issues between the publications of full reports. Updated reports may focus on particular population subgroups or issues relating to physical activity.

A federal agency that proposes to issue physical activity recommendations that differ from the recommendations in the most recent full report must submit the proposed recommendations to HHS for review.</summary>
