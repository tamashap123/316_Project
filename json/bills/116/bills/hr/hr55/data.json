If it is not, the FCC shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and promoting competition. The term \"broadband desert\" means a census block in an urban area in which fewer than 33% of end-user premises do not have access to advanced telecommunications capability."
