A covered call is generally one that (1) is made by an automatic dialing system, (2) uses an artificial or prerecorded voice and\u00a0is not initiated for emergency purposes, or (3) violates the do-not-call-registry.\n\nThe FTC must provide monetary compensation for the identification and prevention of covered calls and enable participants to share funds recovered from violations."
