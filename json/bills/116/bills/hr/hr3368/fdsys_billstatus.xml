          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Apprenticeship and Jobs Training Act of 2019</b></p> <p>This bill allows employers a business-related tax credit for up to $5,000 for the training of a qualified individual in a qualified apprenticeship program or multi-employer apprenticeship program. </p> <p>A "qualified individual" is an individual who (1) is an apprentice participating in a&nbsp;qualified apprenticeship program or multi-employer apprenticeship program, (2)&nbsp;has been employed in either program for a period of at least seven months that ends within the taxable year, and (3) is not a highly compensated employee or a seasonal worker.</p> <p>A "qualified apprenticeship program" is a program that &nbsp;(1) provides qualified individuals with on-the-job training and instruction for a qualified occupation (i.e., a skilled trade occupation in a high-demand mechanical, technical, health care, or technology field); (2) is registered with the Office of Apprenticeship of the Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency recognized by the office; and (3) maintains records relating to the qualified individual. </p> <p>A "qualified multi-employer apprenticeship program" is a program in which multiple employers are required to contribute and that is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements.</p> <p>The bill also allows certain distributions, without penalty, from&nbsp;retirement and pension plans to an employee who is serving as a mentor. A "mentor" is a working individual who (1) has attained age 55; (2) works reduced hours and engages in mentoring activities for at least 20% of such hours; and (3) is responsible for the training and education of employees or students in an area of expertise for which such individual has a professional credential, certificate, or degree. </p>]]></text>
