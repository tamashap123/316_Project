This bill prohibits any federal agency or federal government contractor from making a monetary payment to any official of a foreign country for the purposes of bribery, coercion, or any illegal activity that undermines the rule of law or corrupts a public official. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) shall report to Congress on all monetary payments made by the CIA to officials of the Government of Afghanistan on or after September 11, 2001.

The President may waive such requirements if compliance would harm U.S. national security or members of the Armed Forces.</summary>
