This bill requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to establish a grant program that supports violence prevention efforts. Specifically, the CDC must award grants to trauma centers or nonprofit entities for the purpose of conducting or expanding research on the effectiveness of violence prevention efforts in reducing re-injury and re-incarceration that is caused by interpersonal violence. The CDC must also publish best practices for preventing interpersonal violence based on findings from the grant program.</summary>
