    "text": "Building Our Opportunities to Survive and Thrive Act of 2019\n\nThis bill creates a new refundable tax credit of $3,000 for individual taxpayers subject to\u00a0an income-based phaseout and an inflation adjustment to the credit amount after 2019. It also provides for advance payments of credit amounts to taxpayers on a monthly basis and allows a disregard of credit amounts for purposes of determining eligibility for federal or state assistance programs.\n\nThe bill directs the\u00a0Internal Revenue Service to establish a Community Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Matching Grant Program to provide tax return preparation assistance to low-income taxpayers.\n\nThe bill expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that the cost of this bill should be fully offset by (1)\u00a0the repeal of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (except for provisions of that Act that provide relief to taxpayers with annual incomes of less than $100,000), and (2) a fee on financial institutions with consolidated assets of more than $50 billion."
