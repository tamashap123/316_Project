It requires the Department of the Treasury to make available to the public an overview of the laws and regulations related to IRAs and examples of common IRA errors and how to avoid them.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to (1) reduce penalties for taxpayers who voluntarily correct certain IRA errors, including excess contributions and failures to take required minimum distributions; (2) eliminate the 10% additional tax on early distributions that are attributable to withdrawal of interest or other income earned on excess contributions to an IRA; (3) repeal the tax disqualification penalty (loss of tax-exempt status) for accounts where employees engage in certain prohibited transactions; and (4) revise the statute of limitations for collecting certain taxes in connection with an IRA.\n\nTreasury must expand the Employee Plans Compliance Resolution System to allow trustees, custodians, and issuers of IRAs to address inadvertent failures for which an IRA owner was not at fault."
