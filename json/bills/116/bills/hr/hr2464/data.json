Specifically, HHS must award grants to trauma centers or nonprofit entities for the purpose of conducting or expanding research on the effectiveness of violence prevention efforts in reducing re-injury and re-incarceration that is caused by intentional violent trauma, excluding intimate partner violence. HHS must also publish best practices for preventing intentional violent trauma based on findings from the grant program."
