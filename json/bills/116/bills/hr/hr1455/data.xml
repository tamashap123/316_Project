This bill limits restrictions on and penalties for certain cannabis-related activities that are authorized by state or local law (i.e., state-authorized).

Specifically, the bill prohibits the use of funds made available by Congress to a federal department or agency

 to restrict the state-authorized use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of cannabis; to detain, prosecute, sentence, or initiate civil proceedings against an individual, business, or property involved in state-authorized cannabis-related activities; or to penalize a financial institution for providing financial services to a business engaged in state-authorized cannabis-related activities.</summary>
