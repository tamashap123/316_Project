  <summary date="2019-04-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill expands requirements for lead-level testing or screening as part of well-baby care under the TRICARE program of health care for members and dependents. It prescribes testing for the level of lead in the blood at the ages of both 12 and 24 months for children who may be at elevated risk of lead exposure. Test results shall be provided to state health departments (or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in the case of children residing abroad).

The Government Accountability Office shall study the effectiveness of such screening, testing, and treatment for lead exposure and poisoning.

The Department of Defense shall maintain records concerning the year housing for military personnel was built, and members must provide notice of when their residence was built as a condition of receiving a housing allowance.</summary>
