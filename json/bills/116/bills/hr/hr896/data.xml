This bill requires radio and television broadcasters to make free broadcast time available for political advertising.

Specifically, during an election year, broadcasters generally must&#160;allot at least two hours of free broadcast time to each qualified political candidate in a statewide or national election. A broadcaster that&#160;fails or refuses to comply with the bill shall not have its&#160;license or franchise renewed.</summary>
