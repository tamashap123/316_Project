It makes available 50% of that amount for the construction of additional physical barriers and roads near the border to deter illegal crossings into the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the bill prohibits the release of seized currency or contraband that likely belongs to or supports a foreign, illegal trafficking organization while a civil forfeiture action is pending."
