This bill directs the Department of State to prioritize assistance to develop energy infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe, in particular for projects involving the European Commission and governments in the region. Assistance shall include political and diplomatic support and funding assistance.

Projects eligible for such assistance include infrastructure for natural gas, electricity transmission, and renewable energy. The State Department shall give preference to projects that (1) link the energy systems of two or more countries in the region, (2) have been identified by the European Commission as integral for regional energy security, (3) are expected to enhance energy market integration, (4) can attract other sources of funding, and (5) can potentially use U.S. goods and services.

The President shall report to Congress annually about U.S. assistance provided under this bill.</summary>
