  <summary date="2019-05-15T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Department of Defense Climate Resiliency and Readiness Act

 This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) to provide a strategy to achieve aggregate net zero energy by non-operational sources by no later than December 31, 2029. The term "net zero energy" means a reduction in overall energy use, maximized energy efficiency, implementation of energy recovery and cogeneration capabilities, and an offset of the remaining demand for energy with production of energy from onsite renewable energy sources.

Annual DOD budget submissions must include an item for climate-related adaptation and mitigation, as well as an estimate of adverse impacts to readiness and costs.

 Regarding DOD procurement (1) contracts must contain an estimate of total projected energy consumption and a statement concerning renewable energy and energy efficiency investments; (2) contractors must evaluate climate change risks, including by describing relevant corporate governance processes; and (3) a contractor will be assessed a fee if it consumes more energy than it produces.

DOD must develop a vulnerability and risk assessment tool to measure risks to systems, installations, and operational capabilities.

 Strategic decisions regarding an installation must consider risks associated with climate change, and DOD shall incorporate these into the National Defense Strategy, the National Military Strategy, and operational plans.

DOD shall conduct a research and development program concerning hybrid microgrid systems and electric grid energy storage.

With respect to base realignment and closure activities, DOD shall consider current and potential vulnerabilities to military installations and operations resulting from climate change and their resilience.

 The bill establishes the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense of Energy and Climate Resiliency.</summary>
