    "text": "Rural Maternal and Obstetric Modernization of Services Act or the Rural MOMS Act\n\nThis bill expands initiatives to address maternal health in rural areas.\n\nThe bill provides funding for the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to establish rural obstetric networks for improving outcomes in birth and maternal morbidity. Specifically, these networks must (1) connect individuals with care providers, (2) identify successful maternal-care models, (3) facilitate collaboration among rural providers, (4) provide training and guidance, (5) collaborate with academic institutions that have regional expertise, and (6) measure and address inequities in birth outcomes among rural residents.HRSA also must award five-year demonstration program grants to (1)\u00a0train physicians, medical residents, and other practitioners to provide maternal and obstetric services in rural communities; and (2) support academic programs that\u00a0develop or provide training\u00a0to improve maternal care in rural areas.Further, the bill adds maternal-health services as part of the\u00a0telehealth network and telehealth resource-centers grant programs.The bill also makes a series of changes to the research and reporting requirements of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Government Accountability Office with respect to data\u00a0on maternal-health outcomes."
