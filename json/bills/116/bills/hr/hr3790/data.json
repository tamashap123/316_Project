The credit is equal to 10% of the purchase price of the residence, which may not exceed $1.5 million. The dollar amount of the credit is limited to $8,000 in a taxable year.\n\nThe bill allows the chief executive officer (e.g., governor) of a state to designate certain population census tracts in areas related to federally declared disasters as opportunity zones. This makes investments in the areas eligible for various tax incentives."
