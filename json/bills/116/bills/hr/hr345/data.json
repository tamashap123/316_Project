Among other changes, the bill expands the grant program so that grants may be used to address emerging, infectious mosquito-borne diseases and to improve existing control programs. The CDC must also give preference to applicants that have (1) a public health emergency due to a mosquito-borne disease, or (2) a control program that is consistent with existing state preparedness plans.\n\nThe bill also reauthorizes for FY2020-FY2024 and revises the CDC epidemiology and laboratory capacity grant program, which helps public health agencies improve surveillance and response activities related to infectious diseases."
