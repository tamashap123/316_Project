A DHS detainer request is an order or request to a state or local government to (1) temporarily hold or transport an alien for transfer into federal custody, or (2) notify DHS before releasing an alien from custody.\n\nA government or law enforcement officer that complies with a DHS detainer request shall be acting under the color of federal authority, for the purposes of liability or immunity in a lawsuit filed by the detained individual.\n\nThe bill makes it unlawful for a state or local government to discharge or discriminate against one of its law enforcement officers for complying with a DHS retainer request."
