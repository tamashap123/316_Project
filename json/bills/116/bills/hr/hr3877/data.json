On August 1, 2021, the limit will be increased to accommodate obligations issued during the suspension period.\n\nThe bill also includes provisions that\n\n set forth procedures for enforcing spending and revenue levels consistent with this bill as if they were included in congressional budget resolutions for FY2020 and FY2021; specify limits on advance appropriations; extend the sequestration (automatic spending cuts) for certain mandatory spending programs through FY2029; extend the authority to collect certain customs user fees through FY2029; extend and modify Senate points of order regarding advance appropriations, certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs), and designations of funds for Overseas Contingency Operations; and reset the balances on the Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) scorecards established by the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010."
