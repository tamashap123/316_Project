  <summary date="2019-02-11T13:48:07Z" status="Passed House">This bill modifies whistle-blower protections for federal employees or applicants who disclose classified national security information, or other protected information, that evidences wrongdoing.

Currently, it is unlawful to retaliate against a federal employee for disclosing classified or protected information of wrongdoing to one of the following recipients: (1) the Office of Inspector General of their agency, (2) the U.S. Office of Special Counsel, or (3) a designated agency employee. This bill expands the list of recipients to whom a federal employee may make a protected disclosure to include a supervisor in the employee's direct chain of command.</summary>
