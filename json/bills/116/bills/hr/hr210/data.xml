This bill requires disbursements by presidential inaugural committees to be reasonable, related to the inaugural ceremony, and reported to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Currently, there are no restrictions on disbursements and committees must report donations to the FEC, but not disbursements.

Upon termination, a committee's remaining funds must be donated to charity.</summary>
