The Election Assistance Commission shall issue standards for the administration of early voting in a federal election.\n\nThe bill establishes requirements for the counting of provisional ballots that will be treated as votes.\n\nThe bill allows civil money penalties, intervention by aggrieved parties, and private actions to address Help America Vote Act of 2002 violations by a state or jurisdiction."
