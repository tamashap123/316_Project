This bill directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to report on the use of virtual currencies and online marketplaces in sex and drug trafficking. The GAO must study topics including

 how illicit proceeds are transferred into the U.S. banking system, state and non-state actors that participate in such activity, preventative efforts from federal and state agencies, and the extent to which the unique characteristics of virtual currencies can contribute to the tracking and prosecution of illicit funding.</summary>
