The strategy shall cover topics including how to provide public health commodities, food, and technical assistance. It shall also describe how the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro is blocking entry of humanitarian assistance, and how the United States is coordinating efforts with other countries.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on the impact of U.S. assistance for Venezuelans throughout the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe President shall instruct the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations (U.N.) to convince the U.N. to place the Venezuelan humanitarian and political crisis on its agenda. The Permanent Representative shall also seek a U.N. Presidential Statement and Permanent Resolution urging the Venezuelan government to allow for the delivery of humanitarian aid."
