 This bill modifies the budget enforcement procedures that apply to federal spending for natural disasters and emergencies.

The bill includes provisions that

 eliminate the requirements to adjust annual discretionary spending limits to accommodate additional appropriations for disaster relief and wildfire suppression; increase the number of votes that is required to waive the Senate point of order against emergency spending designations, which exempt spending from discretionary spending limits; and require the Government Accountability Office to report on spending for emergencies and disaster relief.</summary>
