This bill establishes requirements for nonpartisan redistricting and open primary elections.

States must (1) conduct congressional redistricting using a plan developed by a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission, beginning with the 2020 census; and (2) hold open primaries for federal elections.

A state may not use federal funds provided for election administration purposes unless it certifies to the Election Assistance Commission that it (1) conducts redistricting for its state legislative districts using a plan developed by a nonpartisan independent redistricting commission, and (2) holds open primaries for elections for state and local office.</summary>
