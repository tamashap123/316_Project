It also includes any single family residence that is (1) the principal residence of its occupant, (2) located in a rural area which is not within a Metropolitan Statistical Area and has a population of 2,500 or less; and (3) is purchased or improved with the proceeds of a loan secured by property used for the production of one or more agricultural products."
