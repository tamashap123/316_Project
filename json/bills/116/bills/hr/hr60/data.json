    "text": "Better Agriculture Resources Now Act or the BARN Act\n\nThis bill revises the H-2A visa program for temporary nonimmigrant agricultural workers. It moves administration of the program from the Department of Labor to the Department of Agriculture, and eliminates the requirement that employers hire any qualified U.S. applicants until 50% of the time period of the H-2A worker's contract has elapsed.\n\nThe bill also revises requirements for employer-provided housing or housing allowances for H-2A workers, including standards for such accommodations. The employer shall request an inspection of the housing to certify that it meets the required standards.\n\nAliens admittted as H2-A workers who overstay their visas are barred from the program for five years. Aliens admitted on the basis of fraud or who commit certain crimes are barred permanently. Employers who knowingly hire H-2A workers who overstay their visas or employers who engage in fraud or misrepresentation shall be barred from the program."
