This bill requires the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, when deciding whether to issue licenses for hydropower projects, to give equal consideration to minimizing infringement on the useful exercise and enjoyment of property rights held by nonlicensees.

In developing recreational resources within project boundaries, licensees must consider private landownership as a means to encourage and facilitate private investment and increased tourism and recreational use.</summary>
