The system involves federal matching of small contributions for qualified candidates.\n\nThis bill sets forth provisions related to ethics in all three branches of government. Specifically, the bill requires a code of ethics for federal judges and justices, prohibits Members of the House from serving on the board of a for-profit entity, expands enforcement of regulations governing foreign agents, and establishes additional conflict-of-interest and ethics provisions for federal employees and the White House.\n\nThe bill also requires candidates for President and Vice President to submit 10 years of tax returns."
