  <summary date="2019-01-08T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill allows a new tax credit for a taxpayer's employment-related expenses necessary to care for a dependent who has attained age 50.

Employment-related expenses include (1) expenses for household services; and (2) expenses for the care of the dependent, including respite care and hospice care. The expenses must be incurred to enable the taxpayer to be gainfully employed for any period for which there are one or more dependents that qualify for the credit.

The bill limits the amount of such credit to $3,000 for the care of one dependent and $6,000 for the care of two or more dependents of the taxpayer in a taxable year.</summary>
