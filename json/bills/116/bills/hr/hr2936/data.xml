  <summary date="2019-05-22T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Small Business Disaster Relief Act of 2019

This bill provides relief funding for small businesses and enterprises deemed vital to recovery efforts in a disaster area.

Specifically, the bill authorizes the Small Business Administration (SBA) to exceed the $100,000 cap on small business development center assistance grants to accommodate extraordinary occurrences that have a catastrophic impact on small business concerns in a community.

The bill also authorizes the SBA and the Farm Service Agency to provide loans for enterprises that are vital to disaster recovery efforts. Such loans shall be made without reference to limitations imposed by other laws and may waive any required evaluation of creditworthiness in exchange for a fee.</summary>
