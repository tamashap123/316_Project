This bill directs the President to impose sanctions on those responsible for human rights violations related to Iran's government.

The President shall impose sanctions on Iranian persons responsible for or complicit in politically-motivated harassment, abuse, extortion, or extended detention or trial of (1) U.S. citizens and permanent residents, (2) Iranian citizens and residents, or (3) persons of Iranian origin. The sanctions shall include denial and revocation of visas, blocking of property, and restrictions on financial transactions.

The immediate family members of such sanctioned individuals shall be ineligible for admission into the United States, and current visas of such family members shall be revoked.
