It shall also assess ways to develop partnerships between the countries' medical and nursing schools. The plan should ensure that accreditation standards for such schools are comparable so that students in Mexico can pass the licensing exams needed to practice in the United States.\n\nThese programs shall be focused on the region within 100 kilometers of the U.S.-Mexico border."
