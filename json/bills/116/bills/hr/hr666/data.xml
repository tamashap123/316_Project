This bill directs the Department of State to establish a scholarship program for eligible Haitian students who were enrolled as full-time or part-time students in a Haitian or U.S. university or institution of higher education and whose studies were interrupted as a result of the January 12, 2010, earthquake or the October 4, 2016, Hurricane Matthew. A Haitian student who receives such a scholarship shall return to Haiti for at least two years upon completion of an undergraduate or graduate degree.

The State Department may make grants to institutions of higher education that have enrolled a significant number of Haitian students who were enrolled in a Haitian university at the time of such earthquake or hurricane. Such grants shall be used to provide social and educational support services.</summary>
