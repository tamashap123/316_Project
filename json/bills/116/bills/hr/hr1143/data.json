(Short-term, limited-duration insurance coverage is designed to fill a temporary gap in insurance coverage.)Insurers must further disclose that this type of coverage is temporary, provides limited benefits, and is subject to termination. Insurers may not enroll an individual in a short-term, limited-duration insurance plan during any time in which that individual is eligible for open enrollment in coverage through the health insurance exchange."
