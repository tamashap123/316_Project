In distributing grants under the program, DOT shall ensure an equitable geographic distribution of funds, an appropriate balance in addressing the needs of urban and rural areas, and investment in a variety of transportation modes. At least 20% of grant funds must be set aside for projects in rural areas.\n\nThe bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to: (1) establish a National Infrastructure Investment Trust Fund, and (2) increase the tax on gasoline other than aviation gasoline and on diesel fuel or kerosene."
