  <summary date="2019-02-06T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">State Mineral Revenue Protection Act of 2019 

This bill increases the percentage that states receive from sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals for all public land or mineral deposits located in the states by eliminating administrative costs that are deducted from the share allocated to states under current law.

The bill eliminates the 2% fee that the federal government currently deducts from a state's share to cover administrative or other costs.

On request of a state, the Department of the Interior must convey to the state a property interest in the state's share of royalties and other payments from public land or mineral deposits located in the state.Interior must provide prompt notice of any such conveyance and the duty of the leaseholder to make direct payments to the state.</summary>
