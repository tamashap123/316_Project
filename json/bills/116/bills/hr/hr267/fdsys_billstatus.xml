        <text>Rule provides for consideration of H.R. 264, H.R. 265, H.R. 266 and H.R. 267. Measure will be considered read. Bill is closed to amendments. The rule provides one hour of debate, orders the previous question, and allows one motion to commit on each bill. The rule waives the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House with respect to any resolution reported through the legislative day of January 15, 2019, relating to a measure making or continuing appropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2019.</text>

          <text><![CDATA[<p><b>Highlights</b></p> <p>This bill provides FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and several related agencies. </p> <p>The bill includes both discretionary and mandatory funding. The HUD budget is primarily discretionary spending, and most of the DOT budget is mandatory spending, in the form of contract authority from the Highway Trust Fund. </p> <p><b>Full Summary</b></p> <p><b>Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2019 </b></p> <p>TITLE I--DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION </p> <p><i>Department of Transportation Appropriations Act, 2019 </i></p> <p>This title provides FY2019 appropriations for the Department of Transportation (DOT). </p> <p>The title provides appropriations for the Office of the Secretary, including</p> <ul> <li> Salaries and Expenses; </li> <li> Research and Technology; </li> <li> National Infrastructure Investments (also known as BUILD grants); </li> <li> the National Surface Transportation and Innovative Finance Bureau; </li> <li> Financial Management Capital; </li> <li> Cyber Security Initiatives; </li> <li> the Office of Civil Rights; </li> <li> Transportation Planning, Research, and Development; </li> <li> the Working Capital Fund; </li> <li> the Minority Business Resource Center Program; </li> <li> Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization and Outreach; and </li> <li> Payments to Air Carriers. </li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 101) This section prohibits DOT from approving assessments or reimbursable agreements pertaining to funds appropriated to the modal administrations in this bill except for activities underway on the date of enactment, unless the reprogramming process has been completed. </p> <p>(Sec. 102) This section requires DOT to (1) post on its website the schedule and agenda for all meetings of the Council on Credit and Finance, and (2) direct the council to record the decisions and actions of each meeting. </p> <p>(Sec. 103) This section permits DOT to use the Working Capital Fund to provide payments in advance and accept subsequent reimbursements from all federal agencies for transit benefit distribution services that are necessary to carry out the federal transit pass transportation fringe benefit program. </p> <p>DOT must maintain a reasonable operating reserve in the Working Capital Fund, to be expended in advance to provide uninterrupted transit benefits to government employees. The reserve may not exceed one month of benefits and may be used only for transit benefits. </p> <p>The title provides appropriations to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for</p> <ul> <li> Operations; </li> <li> Facilities and Equipment; </li> <li> Research, Engineering, and Development; and </li> <li> Grants-In-Aid For Airports. </li> </ul> <p>Fund provided by this bill may not be used for</p> <ul> <li> new applicants for the second career training program, </li> <li> new unauthorized aviation user fees, or </li> <li> aeronautical charting and cartography activities through the Working Capital Fund. </li> </ul> <p>The title prohibits funds from being used to eliminate the Contract Weather Observers program at any airport. </p> <p>The title permits funds received from specified public, private, and foreign sources for expenses incurred in the provision of FAA services to be credited to the FAA Operations appropriations account. </p> <p>(Sec. 110) This section limits technical staff-years under the federally funded research and development center contract between the FAA and the Center for Advanced Aviation Systems Development. </p> <p>(Sec. 111) This section prohibits the FAA from requiring airport sponsors to provide the FAA without cost building construction, maintenance, utilities and expenses, or space in sponsor-owned buildings for air traffic control, air navigation, or weather reporting. The prohibition does not apply to negotiations between the FAA and airport sponsors to achieve agreement on "below-market" rates for these items or to grant assurances that require airport sponsors to provide land without cost to the FAA for air traffic control facilities. </p> <p>(Sec. 112) This section permits the FAA to reimburse amounts made available from certain fees to carry out the Essential Air Service program, which was established to ensure that small communities have a minimum level of air service. </p> <p>(Sec. 113) This section permits amounts collected by the FAA for providing technical assistance to foreign aviation authorities to be credited to the Operations account. </p> <p>(Sec. 114) This section prohibits the FAA from paying Sunday premium pay except if an individual worked on a Sunday. </p> <p>(Sec. 115) This section prohibits the FAA from using funds provided by this bill to purchase a store gift card or gift certificate using a government-issued credit card. </p> <p>(Sec. 116) This section prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used for retention bonuses for FAA employees without prior approval of the Assistant Secretary for Administration of DOT. </p> <p>(Sec. 117) This section requires the FAA, upon the request of an owner or operator, to block the display of the owner's or operator's aircraft registration number in the Aircraft Situational Display to Industry program. </p> <p>(Sec. 118) This section prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to pay the salaries and expenses of more than eight political and presidential FAA appointees. </p> <p>(Sec. 119) This section prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to increase fees for navigation products until the FAA provides Congress with a justification for all fees for aeronautical navigation products and explains how the fees are consistent with Executive Order 13642 (Making Open and Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information). </p> <p>(Sec. 119A) This section requires the FAA to notify Congress prior to closing a regional operations center or reducing the services it provides. </p> <p>(Sec. 119B) This section prohibits funds provided by this bill from being used to change weight restrictions or prior permission rules at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. </p> <p>(Sec. 119C) This section prohibits the FAA from withholding consideration and approval of any new application for participation in the Contract Tower Program, including applications from cost-share program participants, if the tower meets the criteria included in the FAA report titled "Establishment and Discontinuance Criteria for Airport Traffic Control Towers." </p> <p>(Sec. 119D) This section specifies restrictions and requirements for FAA actions to limit the use of an Organization Designation Authorization's (ODA's) delegated functions documented in its procedures manual on a type certification project. (Under the ODA program, the FAA may delegate to a private person a matter related to issuing certificates or the examination, testing, and inspection necessary to issue a certificate on behalf of the FAA.) </p> <p>(Sec. 119E) This section requires the FAA to permit intermittent large cargo air carriers to land in remote areas using a mix of available local meteorological weather reports, in place of National Weather Service forecast reports where they do not provide weather coverage. </p> <p>(Sec. 119F) This section allows the transfer of funds from the Grants-in-Aid for Airports account to reimburse certain airports and providers of general aviation ground support services impacted by temporary flight restrictions for any residence of the President that is designated or identified to be secured by the Secret Service. The funds may not be obligated or distributed until an independent audit is completed. </p> <p>(Sec. 119G) This section requires the FAA to report to Congress on the implementation of NextGen at commercial service airports in the United States. (NextGen is a program to modernize and improve the efficiency of the national airspace system, primarily by migrating to satellite-based navigation and aircraft tracking.) </p> <p>The title provides (1) funding from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for Administrative Expenses and Federal-Aid Highways, and (2) appropriations for Highway Infrastructure Programs. </p> <p>(Most of DOT's budget is mandatory budget authority rather than discretionary budget authority. The mandatory budget authority is primarily in the form of contract authority derived from the Highway Trust Fund (HTF).
