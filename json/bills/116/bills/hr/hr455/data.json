Such websites that are not certified within 90 days must be made inaccessible to the public. New websites that collect or store personally identifiable information must be certified before they are made accessible to the public.\n\nWebsites designed for testing and development are exempted if users execute an agreement acknowledging the risks involved.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget must establish and oversee policies and procedures for federal agencies to follow in the event of a breach of information security involving the disclosure of personally identifiable information."
