If the budget proposes an increase in funding for an item, it must also include the amount of the adjustment that is due to inflation and increases in employee salaries or benefits.\n\nThe budget must also include estimates for funding that would be included in the budget for the following year if programs and activities received the same amount of funding as provided in the current year."
