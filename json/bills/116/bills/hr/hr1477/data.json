The State Department shall also devise a strategy to counter such a threat.\n\nThe President shall report to Congress an assessment of the national security risks posed by a potential Russian acquisition of CITGO's U.S. energy infrastructure holdings. CITGO is an energy company owned by Petroleos de Venezuela (PdVSA), a Venezuelan state-owned oil company. A Russian state-owned company has extended a loan to PdVSA, and a default on that loan could result in Russian ownership of CITGO.\n\nThe bill bars the entry into the United States of aliens who have worked on behalf of Russia to support Venezuelan security forces. It also revokes any current visas belonging to such individuals. The President may waive this bar as to an alien if it is in the national interest of the United States to do so."
