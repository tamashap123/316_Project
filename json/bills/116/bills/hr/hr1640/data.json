The petition shall include (1) DNA evidence establishing the parent-child relationship, (2) a written statement that the parent will provide financial support until the alien receives lawful permanent resident status, and (3) proof of the parent's U.S. citizenship and active duty with the Armed Forces abroad.\n\nThe period of authorized admission for aliens with the visa is five years, and 5,000 principal visa aliens may be admitted per fiscal year. Holders of such a visa may adjust to lawful permanent resident status after meeting various requirements, such as being admissible as an immigrant."
