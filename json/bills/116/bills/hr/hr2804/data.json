Specifically, the bill adjusts each state's apportionment based\u00a0not only on certain tax payments attributable to highway users in\u00a0the state, but also on other federal taxes collected\u00a0in\u00a0the state relative to such taxes collected in all states. The bill also caps the apportionment that each state may receive."
