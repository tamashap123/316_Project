DHS shall not use certain information obtained for placing a child with a custodian to apprehend, detain, or deport certain individuals, including the child, proposed sponsor, or a person living with the sponsor.\n\nThe Office of Refugee Settlement shall provide services for unaccompanied alien children after they have been released to help them transition into their communities and to connect them with legal representation. Money appropriated to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for FY2019 shall be redirected to fund such services.\n\nOther money appropriated for ICE shall be redirected to various programs to inspect detention facilities and bolster efforts to prevent child trafficking.\n\nThis bill also establishes the Office of Refugee Resettlement Advisory Committee on Shelters for Unaccompanied Alien Children. The advisory committee may conduct unannounced inspections of Office of Refugee Settlement shelters that hold unaccompanied alien children and shall issue reports on its investigations and recommendations regarding the shelters."
