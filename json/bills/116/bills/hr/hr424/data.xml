This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to require that the designation of the sensitivity level of national security positions be conducted in a consistent manner in all DHS components and offices.

The bill requires DHS (1) by July 6, 2019, and every five years thereafter, to review all sensitivity level designations of national security positions at DHS; (2) if it determines that a change in the sensitivity level is warranted, to administratively adjust access and complete an appropriate level periodic reinvestigation; and (3) to report on such positions requiring access to classified information, no longer requiring access, or requiring a different level of access.

DHS must submit annual reports, through FY2024, on the denials, suspensions, revocations, and appeals of an individual's eligibility for access to classified information.

DHS must (1) develop a plan to achieve greater uniformity regarding the adjudication of eligibility of an individual for access to classified information that is consistent with the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Access to Classified Information, and (2) ensure that all information received for such adjudication is consistent with such guidelines and is protected against misappropriation. The plan shall consider the establishment of an internal appeals panel responsible for final national security clearance denial and revocation determinations.</summary>
