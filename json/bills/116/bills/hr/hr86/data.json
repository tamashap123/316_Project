Withheld salaries are paid when the chamber of Congress agrees to a budget resolution or on the last day of the 116th Congress, whichever is earlier.\n\nThe Inspector General of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), by three days after the President's budget is due, shall (1) make an annual determination of whether the OMB and the President are in compliance with statutory requirements for the President's annual budget submission to Congress, and (2) provide a written notification of such determination to specified congressional committees. The Director, Deputy Director, and Deputy Director for Management of the OMB may not receive pay for any period of noncompliance."
