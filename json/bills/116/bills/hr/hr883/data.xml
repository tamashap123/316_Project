This bill grants lawful permanent resident status to certain aliens who were separated from immediate family members by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Children and their legal guardians or parents shall be eligible if&#160; DHS separated them and failed to demonstrate in a hearing that the legal guardian or parent was unfit or presented a danger to the child. Such a child shall be eligible whether he or she remained in the custody of&#160; DHS or the Office of Refugee Settlement, was released to a sponsor, or repatriated to his or her country of origin.

Individuals who are inadmissible for various grounds, including those related to criminal activity or security concerns, shall not be eligible.

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services shall grant all applications from eligible individuals for humanitarian parole or for lawful permanent resident status, and no application fees may be charged.</summary>
