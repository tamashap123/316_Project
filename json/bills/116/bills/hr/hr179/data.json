The department concerned must offer for sale an equal number of acres of federal land that is under the same jurisdictional status.\n\nThe bill exempts from this requirement any easements acquired to facilitate management of federal lands.\n\nLand sold pursuant to this bill shall be offered for sale at fair market value (based on local comparable sales), with monthly price reductions if the land is not sold in six months.\n\nAll net proceeds from the sale of federal lands pursuant to this bill shall be deposited directly into the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."
