  <summary date="2019-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill states that Congress finds that the United States did not acquire any right, title, or interest in or to submerged lands in Nantucket Sound (near the coast of Massachusetts) or the waters above those submerged lands as a result of the taking described in the civil action, United States v. 3,000 Acres of Land (D. Mass. 1944). That taking involved land that is now part of the Monomoy National Wildlife Refuge.</summary>
