The lactation room must be shielded from public view, be free from intrusion, and contain a chair, a working surface, and (if the building is\u00a0supplied with electricity)\u00a0an electrical outlet.\n\nA public building may be excluded from such requirement at the discretion of the official responsible for its operation if\n\n it does not contain a lactation room for employees and does not have a space that could be repurposed as one or that could be made private by using portable materials, at a reasonable cost; or the cost of new construction required to create a lactation room is not feasible."
