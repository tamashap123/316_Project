  <summary date="2019-01-03T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill directs the Department of State to include additional information in its annual reports concerning Taiwan's participation at the World Health Organization's World Health Assembly (WHA) as an observer. The report shall describe changes and improvements to the State Department's plan to support Taiwan's observer status at the WHA, following any meetings at which Taiwan did&#160;not participate under such status. (China has opposed Taiwan's participation, based on its position that Taiwan is part of China and not a separate country.)</summary>
