This bill prohibits giving assistance, such as various types of economic support or military training, to countries that oppose U.S. positions on more than 50 percent of the recorded votes in the most recent United Nations session.

A country may be exempted if there has been a fundamental change in leadership and policies and the Department of State determines that the country will no longer oppose the U.S. position. The President may exempt a country for U.S. national security interests.</summary>
