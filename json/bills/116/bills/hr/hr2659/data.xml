  <summary date="2019-05-10T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill requires the Office of Fossil Energy to carry out a research, development, and technology demonstration program to improve the energy efficiency of gas turbines used in electric power generation systems. Specifically, the program must develop technologies that will lead to gas turbine combined cycle efficiency of 67% or simple cycle efficiency of 50%. In addition, the program must include field demonstrations of the developed technologies to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility.</summary>
