  <summary date="2019-02-04T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">This bill prohibits consumer reporting agencies from including certain adverse credit information in a consumer report. Specifically, adverse credit information relating to certain employees affected by a federal government shutdown may not be included in a consumer report. The bill also prohibits the head of an agency from making adverse security clearance or access determinations for an individual solely due to their failure to make debt payments as a result of a federal government shutdown.</summary>
