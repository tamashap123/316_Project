States must determine payment methodologies in accordance with specified requirements; payments also temporarily qualify for an enhanced federal matching rate.\n\nFurther, drug manufacturers with Medicaid rebate agreements for covered outpatient drugs must disclose drug product information. Manufacturers are subject to civil penalties for knowingly misclassifying drugs. Manufacturers are also required to compensate for rebates that were initially underpaid as a result of misclassification (whether or not such misclassification was committed knowingly)."
