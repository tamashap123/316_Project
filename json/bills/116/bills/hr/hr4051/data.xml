  <summary date="2019-07-25T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Climate Action Rebate Act of 2019

This bill imposes a carbon fee on the use, sale, or transfer of certain fossil fuels and fluorinated gases&#160;that emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The&#160;fee is imposed on producers and importers of such fuels and is deposited into a Climate Action Rebate Fund established by this bill.&#160;

The bill&#160;establishes an gradual emissions reduction schedule for such fuels between 2020&#160;and 2050 (100% reduction).

The bill requires payment of an equalization fee&#160;by fossil fuels and carbon-intensive imported goods at the border and provides for refunds of comparable exports.

The bill rebates up to 70% of net revenues from the fund&#160;to low-income individuals as a monthly dividend. Remaining revenues&#160;must be used&#160;for investment in infrastructure, energy innovation, and assistance for workers and communities to transition to a cleaner energy economy.

All carbon fee revenue must be spent in accordance with Buy American requirements and the Davis-Bacon Act (requires payment of local prevailing wage on public works projects for laborers and mechanics),</summary>
