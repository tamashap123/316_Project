The\u00a0fee is imposed on producers and importers of such fuels and is deposited into a Climate Action Rebate Fund established by this bill.\u00a0\n\nThe bill\u00a0establishes an gradual emissions reduction schedule for such fuels between 2020\u00a0and 2050 (100% reduction).\n\nThe bill requires payment of an equalization fee\u00a0by fossil fuels and carbon-intensive imported goods at the border and provides for refunds of comparable exports.\n\nThe bill rebates up to 70% of net revenues from the fund\u00a0to low-income individuals as a monthly dividend. Remaining revenues\u00a0must be used\u00a0for investment in infrastructure, energy innovation, and assistance for workers and communities to transition to a cleaner energy economy.\n\nAll carbon fee revenue must be spent in accordance with Buy American requirements and the Davis-Bacon Act (requires payment of local prevailing wage on public works projects for laborers and mechanics),"
