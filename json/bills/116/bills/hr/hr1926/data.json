Liberia's designation was terminated as of May 21, 2017. The President has granted deferred enforced departure status to Liberian nationals, which prevents their removal from the country and provides work authorization, until March 30, 2020.\n\nIndividuals with temporary protected status under this bill shall have employment authorization for the three-year period, and any lapse of authorization between April 1, 2019, and the enactment date of this bill shall not affect the validity of such an individual's employment authorization document."
