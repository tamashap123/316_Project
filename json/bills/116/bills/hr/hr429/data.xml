This bill revises the notification requirement for campaign contributions of $1,000 or more. The bill applies this requirement to (1) any political committee, not just a candidate's principal campaign committee; and (2) cumulative contributions of $1,000 or more during a calendar year, instead of only single contributions. Only the Federal Election Commission (FEC) must be notified, instead of the FEC and others.

Any amount transferred by a joint fundraising committee established by a candidate's authorized committee to any other authorized committee of that candidate shall be treated as a contribution.</summary>
