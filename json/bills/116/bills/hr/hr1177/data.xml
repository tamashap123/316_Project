This bill provides continuing appropriations to certain federal agencies to prevent a government shutdown if an appropriations bill for the agency has not been enacted before the fiscal year begins and continuing appropriations are not in effect.

The bill excludes agencies within or under the legislative branch or the Executive Office of the President, which would continue to be subject to a government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations.</summary>
