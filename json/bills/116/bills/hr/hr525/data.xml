  <summary date="2019-02-25T15:02:20Z" status="Passed House">Strengthening the Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2019

This bill establishes statutory authority and requirements for a partnership between health insurance plans, government agencies, law enforcement, and health care organizations in order to detect and prevent health care waste, fraud, and abuse. The partnership must be established under the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Among other requirements, the partnership must (1) promote data sharing between partners, (2) analyze data to identify fraudulent practices, (3) refer potential criminal cases to law enforcement, and (4) conduct education and outreach.

Currently, HHS and DOJ administer the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership. The purpose of the partnership is to address health care fraud through voluntary data sharing between public and private sectors; the partnership was created in 2012 through agency action. The bill transfers all functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and administrative actions of this partnership to the partnership established under the bill.</summary>
