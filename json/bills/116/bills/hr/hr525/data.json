The partnership must be established under the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control Program, which is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Among other requirements, the partnership must (1) promote data sharing between partners, (2) analyze data to identify fraudulent practices, (3) refer potential criminal cases to law enforcement, and (4) conduct education and outreach.\n\nCurrently, HHS and DOJ administer the Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership. The purpose of the partnership is to address health care fraud through voluntary data sharing between public and private sectors; the partnership was created in 2012 through agency action. The bill transfers all functions, personnel, assets, liabilities, and administrative actions of this partnership to the partnership established under the bill."
