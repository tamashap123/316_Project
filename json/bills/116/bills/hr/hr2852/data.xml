  <summary date="2019-05-20T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Homebuyer Assistance Act of 2019 

This bill modifies requirements for appraisers of Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages. Currently, an appraiser must be certified by certain state or national entities. The bill removes the national entities&#160;from the list of approved certification entities and allows an appraiser to be state-licensed rather than state-certified to meet requirements. The bill also provides specified educational requirements for appraisers.</summary>
