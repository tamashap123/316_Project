  <summary date="2019-01-30T05:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Surface Transportation Investment Act of 2019

 This bill limits or repeals certain tax benefits for major integrated oil companies, including (1) the foreign tax credit for companies that are dual capacity taxpayers, (2) the tax deduction for intangible drilling and development costs, (3) the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas wells, and (4) the tax deduction for qualified tertiary injectant expenses.

The bill modifies the definition of "major integrated oil company" to include certain successors in interest that control more than 50% of the crude oil production or natural gas production of the company.

The bill establishes a Transportation Block Grant Fund and appropriates to the fund amounts equal to the increase in revenues as a result of this bill. The funds must be used for making grants under the Surface Transportation Block Grant Program.</summary>
