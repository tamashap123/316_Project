The certification shall include additional information such as the type of waiver provided to the buyer, the justification for the waiver, and in certain instances the manner in which the sale would help standardization between the buyer's forces and\u00a0the U.S. Armed Forces.\n\nThe President may not waive such nonrecurring charges if the buyer has received (1) $16 million worth of such waivers in the past two years, (2) 15 waivers in the past five years, or (3) $425 million worth of waivers in the past five years.\n\nThe bill also allows Armed Forces salaries and civilian benefits costs to be included as chargeable administrative expenses related to such defense equipment sales."
