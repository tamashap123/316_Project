A person may be ineligible if Treasury reasonably believes that such person knowingly participated in certain forms of government corruption.\n\nThe bill provides for the administration of the program, including reward payment and eligibility.\n\nRewards must, to the extent possible, be paid first from any recovered assets.\n\nTreasury must obtain approval from the Department of Justice before paying a reward under this Act\u00a0in a matter where there is federal criminal jurisdiction."
