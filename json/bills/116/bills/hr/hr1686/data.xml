 This bill requires the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to award grants to physician assistance education programs for clinical education and training. Half of available grant funds must go to programs at underserved sites in rural areas. HRSA must prioritize funding programs that focus on pediatrics, women&#8217;s health, or behavioral health. Further, the bill requires the Department of Health and Human Services to provide grants for research about physician assistant education and reauthorizes through FY2024 the Primary Care Training and Enhancement program.</summary>
