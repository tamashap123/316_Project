This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include full-time employment created for U.S. nationals to count toward the eligibility requirements for an EB-5 commercial enterprise.

The EB-5 program provides an employment-based immigration preference for aliens who establish a commercial enterprise in the United States that creates full-time employment for at least 10 U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. All U.S. citizens are U.S. nationals, but some individuals born in an outlying U.S. possession (i.e., America Samoa and Swains Island) are U.S. nationals but not citizens.</summary>
