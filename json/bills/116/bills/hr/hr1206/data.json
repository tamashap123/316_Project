Currently, a child born outside the United States may automatically acquire citizenship through a parent by satisfying certain requirements.\n\nThe bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to establish that this same citizenship path is available to non-citizen national minors. This path to citizenship is distinct from rights acquired at birth, and is open to individuals such as minors who were adopted by a U.S. citizen."
