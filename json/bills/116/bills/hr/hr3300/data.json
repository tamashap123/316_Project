Among other things, it increases the earned income tax credit in 2019 and 2020 for individuals with no qualifying children, makes the child tax credit fully refundable during the same period, increases the exclusion from employee gross income for employer-provided dependent care assistance, and provides for payments to U.S. possessions related to such credits.\n\nThe bill also eliminates the increase in unrelated business taxable income by expenses for certain fringe benefits for which a tax deduction is not allowed, including transportation and parking benefits or an on-premises athletic facility."
