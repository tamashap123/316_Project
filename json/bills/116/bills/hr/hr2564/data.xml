  <summary date="2019-05-07T04:00:00Z" status="Introduced in House">Medicare Enrollment Protection Act

This bill creates a special Medicare enrollment period for individuals enrolled in, or transitioning out of, continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)&#8212;a federal law that allows an individual to maintain health coverage following loss of coverage due to termination of employment or another qualifying event.

The bill exempts such individuals from certain monthly premium increases associated with delaying Medicare coverage.</summary>
