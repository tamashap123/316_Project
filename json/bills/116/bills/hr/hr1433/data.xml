DHS shall report to the congressional homeland security committees regarding the impacts of the lapse in appropriations between December 22, 2018, and January 25, 2019, on (1) DHS human resources operations; (2) DHS's ability to meet hiring benchmarks; and (3) retention, attrition, and morale of DHS personnel.</summary>
