This bill prohibits the Department of Defense from using funds to test, procure, or field any missile that would be prohibited under the Treaty Between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles. (The President announced in&#160;February 2019&#160;that he intends to withdraw the United States from the treaty, commonly referred to as the "INF Treaty.")</summary>
