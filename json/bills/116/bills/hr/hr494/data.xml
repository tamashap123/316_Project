 (Sec. 2) This bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2024 the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) Program.

It subjects JABG grants to accountability measures. The Office of Inspector General in the Department of Justice (DOJ) must conduct annual audits of selected grant recipients. Additionally, DOJ must identify and report on duplicative grant awards.

(Sec. 3) The bill expresses the sense of Congress that the use of best practices is encouraged for activities carried out with JABG funds.</summary>
