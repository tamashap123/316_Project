    "text": "American Future Healthcare Act of 2019\n\n This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to health savings accounts (HSAs), to\n\n repeal the requirement that an individual making a tax deductible contribution to an HSA be covered by a high deductible health care plan; increase the maximum HSA contribution level; allow Medicare eligible individuals to contribute to an HSA; allow HSAs to be used to purchase health insurance; provide a cost-of-living adjustment for the limits on additional contributions for individuals 55 or older (catch-up contributions); require the cost-of-living adjustments to be indexed to the CPI medical care component (the medical care component for the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Department of Labor); allow a rollover of HSA amounts to a Medicare Advantage Medical Savings Account (MSA); and treat direct primary care service arrangement fees as deductible medical expenses. This bill also allows an individual with alternative health coverage to opt out of Medicare hospital services benefits without also having to opt out of Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance benefits and without having to repay Medicare hospital services benefits already received."
