    "text": "Anti-hunger Empowerment Act of 2019\n\nThis bill reduces administrative requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the food stamp program), authorizes funding to increase access to SNAP offices, and authorizes grants for community-based nonprofits to expand anti-hunger activities.\n\nThe bill repeals existing provisions regarding administrative costs and authorizes the Department of Agriculture (USDA) to pay 75% of the administrative costs for state agencies to carry out new activities to increase the operating hours of SNAP offices, reduce wait times, accept online applications, upgrade technology, and provide a checklist of required documents.\n\nIf a state agency believes that information provided by a SNAP applicant is incorrect or incomplete, the agency must notify the applicant in writing and include instructions for providing the required information. A state may not require an appplicant to appear in person unless the information is not provided in response to the request or cannot be verified. State agencies may not require fingerprints for any member of a household to participate in SNAP or receive benefits.\n\nUSDA must report annually to Congress on the comparative progress of states in improving access to SNAP.\n\n\n\nThe bill also establishes a Beyond the Soup Kitchen Pilot Program to provide grants to community-based nonprofit feeding and anti-hunger groups for programs and technical assistance to reduce hunger, increase the use of nutrition assistance and anti-poverty programs, bolster food security, assist individuals and families to develop assets, promote economic independence, improve nutrition, and reduce obesity."
