It also adds the duty to implement enforcement and supervisory authority regarding the fair lending laws.\n\nSpecified units, offices, and boards of the CFPB must perform their assigned duties and may not be renamed or reorganized.\n\nThe bill amends all statutory references to the \"Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection\" to refer instead to the \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\"\n\nMembership and meeting requirements for the Consumer Advisory Board are also revised."
