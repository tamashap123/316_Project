Under current law, the maximum premium amount for such homebuyers is 2.75% of the original insured principal obligation of the mortgage (compared to 3% for other homebuyers). The bill instead\u00a0requires that the premium amount for such homebuyers be 25 basis points (0.25% of the original insured principal obligation of mortgage) lower than the amount otherwise established by the FHA. The bill also specifies that first-time homebuyers must complete the financial-management counseling program prior to applying for a mortgage or entering into a sales agreement."
