(The program authorized additional payments to certain primary-care practitioners who provided primary-care services on or after January 1, 2011, and before January 1, 2016.)\n\nCurrent law prohibits administrative or judicial review of CMS decisions regarding the eligibility of primary-care practitioners to receive incentive payments under the program. The bill authorizes review of such decisions in cases where the practitioner failed to meet eligibility criteria due to a coding error for provided items and services."
