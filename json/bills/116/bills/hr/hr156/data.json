Specifically, the bill\u00a0provides for\u00a0imprisonment, the\u00a0imposition of additional criminal fines, or both.\n\nThe court shall order a defendant who has been convicted of such an offense to reimburse any such entity for expenses incurred in responding to such conduct. The bill treats such an order of reimbursement as a civil judgment."
