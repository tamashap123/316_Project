Provides for subsequent assessments if an agency determines that the rule will remain in effect.\n\nDirects OIRA to: (1) issue guidance for agencies regarding the development of the framework for, and the conduct of, such reassessments; (2) oversee the compliance of agencies with this Act; and (3) ensure that the results of each reassessment are published promptly on a centralized federal website and noticed in the Federal Register."
