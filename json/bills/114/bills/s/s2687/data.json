(Sec. 3) Each grant-receiving state shall work annually with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce a report including the total number of infants identified and the number of infants for whom a plan of safe care was developed.\n\n(Sec. 4) HHS shall: (1) monitor states to ensure that each one's policies and procedures meet requirements to improve outcomes among infants born and identified as being affected by substance abuse or withdrawal symptoms or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and (2) issue guidance to states regarding the requirements and best practices for the development and implementation of plans of safe care."
