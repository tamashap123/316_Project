The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Health Resources and Services Administration must develop and disseminate information on emergency contraception. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality must study sexual assault survivors' access to emergency contraception.\n\nThe PHSA is amended to establish an Office of the Ombudsperson on Women's Health in HHS to handle complaints involving HHS regarding women's health services and to study the adequacy of health plan provider networks for women's health services.\n\nHHS must coordinate a national public education campaign regarding preventive health services for women and families.\n\nHHS must award states grants to establish maternal mortality review committees to investigate pregnancy-related deaths.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health must organize a national workshop on severe maternal morbidity.\n\nTo eliminate disparities in maternal health outcomes, HHS must conduct research, expand access to services that improve maternity care, and compare and implement interventions for reducing disparities."
