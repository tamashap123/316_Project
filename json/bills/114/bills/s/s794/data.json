(Currently, employees of contractors of the intelligence community are excluded from certain whistleblower protections that are provided to employees of\u00a0contractors of the\u00a0Department of Defense and other federal agencies.)\n\nRequires courts that receive\u00a0a disclosure of information required by executive order to be kept classified (in the interests of national defense or the conduct of foreign affairs) to treat the information in a manner consistent with the interests of the national security of the United States, including through the use of summaries or ex parte submissions if the element of the intelligence community concerned advises the court that such procedures are warranted."
