Defines \"covered interaction\" as an in-person or telephonic official interaction relating to a possible violation of a federal statute or regulation that could result in the imposition of a fine or penalty against, the forfeiture of property by, or the collection of an unpaid tax, fine, or penalty from, the individual or a business owned or operated by the individual.\n\nPermits the employee conducting a covered interaction to record it if the employee: (1) informs the individual prior to or at the initiation of the interaction, and (2) provides the individual with a transcript or copy of the recording upon request and with the individual's reimbursement.\n\nRequires the employee, before or at an initial covered interaction, to provide to the individual a verbal or written notice of such individual's rights under this Act.\n\nExempts any such interaction that is likely to include the discussion of: (1) classified material; or (2) information that, if released publicly, would endanger public safety or an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\nSubjects any executive agency employee who violates this Act to disciplinary action."
