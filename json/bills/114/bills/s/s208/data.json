Requires the BSVC to assess and the Comptroller General to report on the statistical validity of the data and methodology used to develop such metrics.\n\nEstablishes the BSVC and a special congressional commission on border security to determine the criteria for recommending the three presidential appointees to the BSVC. Terminates the BSVC after determining the accuracy of the tenth annual metrics submission required under this Act.\n\nDirects the\u00a0Border Patrol\u00a0to impose a consequence for each alien apprehended pursuant to the Border Patrol's Consequence Delivery System.\n\nAuthorizes the Border Patrol to alter the capability deployment requirements of this Act upon determining that the principal border security threats require alteration.\n\nAuthorizes the\u00a0Department of Defense (DOD) to allocate additional DOD aviation assets to the southern border to assist\u00a0DHS in achieving situational awareness and operational control.\n\nSets personnel levels for the Border Patrol's active duty agents, CBP's Office of Field Operations officers, and CBP's Office of Air and Marine agents.\n\nRequires: (1) DHS to ensure a minimum of not fewer than 130,000 annual flight hours of the Office of Air and Marine, and (2) the Office of Air and Marine to operate unmanned aerial systems not less than 16 hours per day, seven days per week. Requires the Office of Air and Marine to assign the greatest prioritization to support Border Patrol requests to gain and maintain situational awareness and operational control of high traffic areas and operational control and situational awareness along the southern border.\n\nAuthorizes the Border Patrol to transfer its agents, on a voluntary basis, to high traffic areas and to provide an incentive bonus for any such transfer.\n\nProhibits the Departments of the Interior or Agriculture (USDA) from impeding, prohibiting, or restricting CBP activities on federal land located within 100 miles of the U.S. border with Mexico to execute search and rescue operations, and to prevent all unlawful entries into the United States.\n\nDirects DHS: (1) to submit an implementation plan to establish a biometric exit data system to complete the integrated biometric entry and exit data system; (2) within two years after enactment of this Act, to establish a biometric exit data system at the 15 U.S. airports and the 15 U.S. seaports that support the highest volume of international air and sea travel and the 15 U.S. land ports of entry that support the highest volume of pedestrian crossings; and (3) within five years, to expand such system to all land, air, and sea ports of entry.\n\nProhibits travel, training, bonuses, or salary increases for DHS political appointees if the metrics requirements, the objectives relating to the achievement of situational awareness and operational control, or the biometric exit data system requirements are not met.\n\nDirects DHS to submit a northern border threat analysis.\n\nAmends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish in DHS a program known as Operation Stonegarden, under which DHS shall make grants to eligible law enforcement agencies to enhance border security.\n\nAuthorizes the sale or donation of certain excess personal property of DOD for border security activities.\n\nDirects DOD to reimburse states for the cost of the deployment of any National Guard units or personnel to perform operations and missions under State Active Duty status in support of a southern border mission, subject to a specified cap.\n\nDirects DHS to hire, train, and assign to duty, by September 30, 2019: (1) 5,000 full-time CBP officers to serve on all inspection lanes and enforcement teams at U.S. land ports of entry on the U.S. borders with Canada and Mexico; and (2) 350 full-time support staff for all U.S. ports of entry.\n\nDirects DHS to submit: (1) a report on a plan for ensuring the placement of sufficient CBP officers on outbound inspections, and adequate outbound infrastructure, at all land ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border; (2) a report on a plan for each of DHS, USDA, and the Department of Health and Human Services for ensuring the placement of sufficient CBP agriculture specialists, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service entomologist identifier specialists, Food and Drug Administration consumer safety officers, and other relevant and related personnel at all land ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border; and (3) an annual report that details the implementation plan for required staff enhancements.\n\nDirects DHS to ensure that each CBP officer is equipped with a secure two-way communication and satellite-enabled device that allows CBP officers to communicate between ports of entry and inspection stations and with law enforcement entities.\n\nRequires DHS to establish a program for awarding grants for the purchase of: (1) identification and detection equipment; and (2) mobile, hand-held, two-way communication devices for law enforcement officers serving on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAuthorizes CBP to aid in the enforcement of federal customs, immigration, and agriculture laws by: (1) designing, constructing, and modifying U.S. ports of entry, living quarters for personnel, technology and equipment, and other structures and facilities; (2) acquiring land necessary to carry out CBP's duties; (3) implementing a biometric exit data system; and (4) constructing additional ports of entry along the U.S.borders with Mexico and Canada.\n\nDirects CBP, in coordination with the General Services Administration (GSA), to give priority consideration to projects that will substantially:\n\n reduce commercial and passenger vehicle and pedestrian crossing wait times at ports of entry; increase trade, travel efficiency, and the projected total annual volume at ports of entry; enhance safety and security at border facilities; reduce the flow of cross-border threats; and substantially reduce passenger vehicle and pedestrian crossing wait times by upgrading or expanding existing ports of entry.
