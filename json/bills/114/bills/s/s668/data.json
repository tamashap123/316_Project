Allows the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to exempt certain data brokers from this Act.\n\nRequires data brokers to establish procedures to ensure the accuracy of: (1) the personal information they collect, assemble, or maintain; and (2) any other information that specifically identifies an individual, unless the information only identifies an individual's name or address.\n\nRequires data brokers to provide individuals a cost-free means to review their personal or identifying information.\n\nAllows individuals to dispute the accuracy of their personal information with a written request that the data broker make a correction.\n\nRequires a data broker, with regard to disputed public record information that is available for public inspection from federal, state, or local governments, to: (1) inform the individual of the source of the information and, if reasonably available, where to direct the individual's request for correction; or (2) correct the inaccuracy in the broker's records if the individual provides proof that the public record has been corrected or that the broker was reporting the information incorrectly.\n\nRequires a data broker, with regard to disputed non-public information of a private nature, to: (1) note the information that is disputed, (2) independently verify the information, and (3) correct the inaccuracy if the broker was reporting the information incorrectly.\n\nRequires data brokers to provide individuals with a reasonable means of expressing a preference to exclude their information from being used, shared, or sold for marketing purposes.\n\nSets forth authority for the FTC and states to enforce this Act."
