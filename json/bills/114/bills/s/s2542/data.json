A \"residential pediatric recovery center\" is a facility that treats infants with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is caused by exposure to opioids before birth.\n\nWith respect to certifying such facilities, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid must establish guidelines that: (1)\u00a0include requirements specifically applicable to treating infants with NAS, and (2) take into account that certain requirements needed for centers that treat adults may not be necessary for facilities that treat such infants. A residential pediatric recovery center\u00a0may satisfy the requirements set forth in these guidelines in lieu of any comparable requirements otherwise applicable for purposes of the center's participation\u00a0under a state Medicaid program.\n\nA\u00a0facility licensed by a state as a residential pediatric recovery center shall be treated as\u00a0having satisfied\u00a0certification requirements for participation under\u00a0the Medicaid program for that state.\u00a0"
