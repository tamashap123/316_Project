The EPA must make all the information and data that it reviewed in making a determination publicly available.\n\nThe EPA's authority to withdraw a specification of a defined area as a disposal site for the discharge of dredged or fill materials is eliminated.\n\nAny previous action by the EPA that occurred outside of this period to deny or restrict a permit or to prohibit the specification of any defined area as a disposal site is nullified."
