HHS shall also:\n\n develop and implement processes to open and review claims denied on or after January 1, 2011, and before enactment of this Act, due solely to the face-to-face documentation requirements; issue revised decisions of such denials as if the requirements of related regulations did not apply at the time such services were furnished; and establish a voluntary process for home health agencies to enter into a settlement agreement with HHS in lieu of reprocessing claims whose payment this bill now requires."
