    "text": "College for All Act\n\nThis bill directs the Department of Education (ED) to award grants to states to eliminate tuition and required fees at public institutions of higher education (IHEs).\n\nIt also amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to:\n\n modify provisions related to interest rates on federal student loans to revise rates applicable to new loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2015; allow student loan borrowers to modify interest rates on outstanding federal student loans to current rates; reauthorize the Federal Work Study program for FY2016-FY2020; eliminate existing base guarantees of Federal Work Study funds to IHEs and require funds to be allocated based solely on the aggregate need of the institution\u2019s students; authorize ED to establish a pilot program to streamline the federal financial assistance application process and reduce the need for students to apply for financial assistance each year; and require ED to use tax information from the second preceding tax year (the \u201cprior, prior year\u201d) to determine a student\u2019s financial aid eligibility. Inclusive Prosperity Act of 2015\n\nTo offset the cost, this bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to impose a transaction tax on certain securities transfers. An individual taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $50,000 ($75,000 for married taxpayers filing joint returns) is eligible for a tax credit for the amount of tax paid on covered transactions."
