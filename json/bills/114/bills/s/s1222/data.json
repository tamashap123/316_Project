    "text": "Continuity of Electric Capacity Resources Act \n\nThis bill amends the Federal Power Act to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to notify transmission organizations that they must file an electric capacity resources report if they have a tariff on file that addresses the procurement of electric capacity resources.\n\nReport contents must:\n\n identify electric capacity resources available to the transmission organization; describe the fuel sources and operational characteristics of each electric capacity resource; evaluate the financial health, viability, and projected remaining years of service of these available electric capacity resources; and assess the current and projected reliability of the elements of the bulk-power system under the transmission organization's control. Subsequent to this report, transmission organizations must also submit tariff amendments that would achieve specified objectives, including a diverse generation portfolio and the availability of transmission facilities and transmission support services that would provide a continuous supply of electricity for customers.\n\nThe bill shields any person from liability for actions taken to comply with a FERC order for temporary connections and exchanges of facilities during war or an energy emergency."
