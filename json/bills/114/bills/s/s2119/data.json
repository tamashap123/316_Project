    "text": "Iran Policy Oversight Act of 2015\n\nThis bill directs the Department of State, the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, and the Director of National Intelligence to submit to Congress every two years a joint 10-year strategy to counter Iranian activities in the Middle East, North Africa, and beyond.\n\nThe President is authorized to:\n\n take appropriate measures to enhance Israel's qualitative military edge, deter Iranian conventional and nuclear threats, and counter non-peaceful Iranian nuclear activities; provide any additional foreign military financing to Israel in FY2018-FY2028 to address Iranian threats; and accelerate co-development and support Israeli development of missile defense systems, and to engage in discussions to bolster Israel's conventional deterrent and deepen intelligence cooperation. The President shall provide assistance to ensure Israel's qualitative military edge and deter Iranian conventional and nuclear threats.\n\nIt is the sense of Congress that Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control should be fully funded to ensure strict enforcement of sanctions against Iranian actors in the areas of ballistic or cruise missile proliferation, terrorism, and human rights abuses, and to ensure effective re-imposition of sanctions in the event of Iran's violation or breach of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).\n\n U.S. property sanctions shall be continued against Iranian persons/entities engaged in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including missile proliferation, terrorism, or human rights abuses, until the President makes public a notification that justifies lifting sanctions.\n\nThe President shall report to Congress every 180 days regarding specified uses of funds by Iran received as part of sanctions relief under the JCPOA.\n\nIf the President determines that Iran has directed or conducted an act of terrorism against the United States or that Iran has substantially increased its operational or financial support for a terrorist organization that threatens U.S. interests or allies, there shall be an expedited procedure for congressional approval of new sanctions against Iran.\n\nThe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 is amended to require the President to report to Congress every 180 days regarding Iranian research and development and breakout times.\n\nThe President shall designate within the State Department a special coordinator for implementation of and compliance with the JCPOA regarding the Iran's nuclear program.\n\nIt is the sense of Congress that:\n\n Iran should continue to be prohibited from undertaking any activity related to ballistic or cruise missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons; and the International Atomic Energy Agency must have sufficient funding, manpower, and authority to undertake its verification responsibilities related to the JCPOA or any other related agreement."
