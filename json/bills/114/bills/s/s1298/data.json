The BTS shall commission a working group, from which it shall obtain recommendations for:\n\n specifications and data measurements for such port performance measures; additionally needed data elements for measuring port performance; and a process for the Department of Transportation (DOT) to collect timely and consistent data, including identifying safeguards to protect proprietary information. The BTS shall ensure that the statistics compiled under this Act are readily accessible to the public, consistent with applicable security constraints and confidentiality interests.\n\nThe bill subjects such port performance measures to specified BTS disclosure restrictions.\n\n(Sec. 4) DOT shall submit to Congress by one year before, and by three months before, the expiration of a maritime labor agreement and monthly thereafter until a new agreement is adopted, a report that includes port performance indicators at affected ports, including:\n\n the number and type of vessels awaiting berthing, including average wait time; the number of cancelled vessel calls; an estimate of the economic impact associated with any delays both at the port and across the national economy; an estimate of the amount of time required to clear any congestion; the average number of positions ordered and filled; and any other factors that might have created delays."
