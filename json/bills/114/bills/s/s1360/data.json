    "text": "This bill revises the limitation on passenger rail transportation liability to increase from $200 million to $500 million, adjusted annually for inflation, the aggregate allowable awards to all rail passengers, against all defendants, for all claims, including any for punitive damages, arising from a single accident or incident.\n\nThe Department of Transportation (DOT) must consider, within two years after enactment of this Act, whether to:\n\n make any needed additional adjustments to the liability cap; and establish or adjust mandatory coverage for Amtrak, any high-speed railroad authority or operator, any commuter authority or operator, any rail carrier, or any state (listed entities). The total minimum liability coverage Amtrak must maintain for claims through insurance and self-insurance shall increase from $200 million per accident or incident to $500 million, unless DOT, by regulation, determines that a different minimum level of financial responsibility is necessary or sufficient to satisfy claims.\n\nDOT may make a grant to Amtrak or another listed entity as a reasonable reimbursement, considering ability to meet increased costs and impacts on safety and service, to offset any incremental increase in the cost of insurance resulting from this Act."
