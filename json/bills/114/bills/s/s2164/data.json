    "text": "This bill extends the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Program through FY2025 at FY2011 funding levels. This Program provides payments to state jurisdictions to compensate for the cost of providing services in tax-exempt federal lands within such jurisdictions. Payments under\u00a0such Act for FY2016 and each fiscal year thereafter shall be exempt from direct spending reductions under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\nThe bill eliminates the fiscal year limitation on funding for the Payments in Lieu of Taxes Program. This Program compensates local governments for tax revenue lost due to tax-exempt federal lands within their boundaries.\n\nThe bill amends the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to make permanent the authorization for the Land and and Water Conservation Fund. Amounts in such Funds remain available for expenditure to carry out such Act without further appropriation or fiscal year limitation. Not less than 1.5% the annual authorized funding amount under such Act shall be made available for projects that secure recreational public access to existing federal public land for hunting, fishing, and other recreational purposes."
