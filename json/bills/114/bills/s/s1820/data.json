    "text": "Early Participation in Regulations Act of 2015\n\nDefines a \"major rule\" as a rule that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) determines is likely to impose: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S. enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises.\n\nDirects an agency, not later than 90 days before publishing a notice of proposed rule making for a major rule in the Federal Register, to publish advance notice of proposed rule making for such rule. Requires such advance notice to: (1) include a written statement identifying the nature and significance of the problem to be addressed, the legal authority under which the rule is proposed, and an achievable objective for the rule and metrics for measuring progress toward that objective; and (2) solicit and provide a period of at least 60 days for submission of written data, views, and argument from interested persons.\n\nMakes this Act inapplicable to a major rule: (1) for which the proposing agency is not required to publish a notice of proposed rule making, (2) if OIRA determines that the requirements described in this Act would not serve the public interest, or (3) if the agency proposing the major rule is otherwise specifically exempted by law from notice and comment rule making procedures."
