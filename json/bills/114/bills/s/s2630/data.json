The bill specifies additional disclosures that must be in each pay stub, including the pay period covered, the employee's name, the total hours worked by the employee, benefits, allowances, and reimbursements.\n\nThe bill also prescribes the form of the pay stub as well as employer notice requirements.\n\nAn employer shall keep records of the information disclosed in an employee's pay stub for three years from each stub's issuance.\n\nIn the event that an employee who is not subject to minimum wage and maximum hourexemptions requests an inspection of his or her records, the employer shall provide copies of them for up to three years before the request.\n\nThe bill prescribes civil penalties for employer failure to comply with this Act."
