The expanded summary of the Senate reported version is repeated here.)\n\nDistrict of Columbia Courts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 2) Amends the District of Columbia Code to authorize the Executive Officer of the District of Columbia courts to:\n\n collect debts owed to the District of Columbia courts because of erroneous payments made to current and former court employees, or any other debt; and purchase uniforms to be worn by certain nonjudicial employees of the District courts, so long as the cost of furnishing a uniform during a year does not exceed the amount applicable to the uniform allowance for federal employees. (Sec. 3) Amends the National Capital Revitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997 to authorize the Director of the Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency to develop and operate intermediate incentive programs for sentenced offenders.\n\nMakes permanent the Director's authority to accept, solicit, and use on behalf of the Agency: (1) any monetary or nonmonetary gift, donation, bequest, or use of facilities, property, or services to aid or facilitate the work of the Agency; and (2) reimbursements from the District government for space and services provided, on a cost reimbursable basis.\n\n(Sec. 4) Amends the District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure Act of 1970 to:\n\n authorize the Public Defender Service, upon approval of the Board of Trustees, to accept (as currently allowed) and use public grants, private contributions, and voluntary and uncompensated (gratuitous) services to assist it; and deem members of the Board of Trustees, as of October 21, 1998, to be employees of the Service instead of District employees for purposes of any action brought against them."
