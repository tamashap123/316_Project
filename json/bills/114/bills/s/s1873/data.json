CBP shall provide information to assist the Under Secretary monitor program management.\n\nThe Under Secretary shall submit a plan to Congress for border security technology testing and evaluation so that such new technologies are evaluated through a series of assessments, processes, and audits to ensure compliance with departmental acquisition policies and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, as well as the effectiveness of taxpayer dollars.\n\n(Sec. 3) No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act."
