It also limits funding that may be used under the Clean Vessel Act for capital improvement and infrastructure projects to support facilities that meet state requirements for minimizing the introduction of pollutants into waterways.\n\nThe formula and requirements for allocating funds for administrative expenses are modified.\n\n Amounts are set aside through FY2023 for recreational boating safety personnel and activities, the National Boating Safety Advisory Council, boating safety activities of national nonprofit public service organizations, and the National Recreational Boating Survey.\n\n The bill revokes a limitation on the amount the Coast Guard is authorized to allocate for national boating safety activities of national nonprofit public service organizations.\n\nThe advisory council is extended through FY2023."
