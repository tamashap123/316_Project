The National Academy of Sciences must publish the evaluations.\n\n(Sec. 606) As an offset, this title reduces the authorization of appropriations for financial assistance under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program for FY2022.\n\nTITLE VII--INFANT PLAN OF SAFE CARE IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\nInfant Plan of Safe Care Improvement Act \n\n(Sec. 702) This bill amends the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act to require the national clearinghouse for information relating to child abuse to maintain and disseminate information about requirements and best practices relating to the development of plans of safe care for infants born affected by illegal substance abuse symptoms, withdrawal symptoms, or a Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder.\n\n(Sec. 703) The plan of safe care for such infants that is required for a state to receive a grant to improve its child protective services system must: (1) address the health and substance use disorder treatment needs of the infant and affected family or caregiver, and (2) specify a system for monitoring whether and in what manner local entities are providing services in accordance with state requirements.\n\n(Sec. 704) Annual state data reports must include the number of such infants, the number for whom a plan of safe care was developed, and the number for whom referrals are made for services, including services for the affected family or caregiver.\n\n(Sec. 705) HHS must monitor state compliance with child protective services system grant requirements.\n\nTITLE VIII--NAS HEALTHY BABIES ACT\n\nNurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act or the NAS Healthy Babies Act\n\n(Sec. 802) The GAO must report on:\n\n the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which is the symptoms of withdrawal in a newborn; NAS treatment services for which coverage is available under state Medicaid programs; the care settings and reimbursement for NAS treatment; the prevalence of use of various care settings for NAS treatment under state Medicaid programs; any federal barriers to treating infants with NAS under state Medicaid programs; and its recommendations for improvements that will ensure access to NAS treatment under state Medicaid programs.

The Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality must fund an evaluation of the pilot program.\n\n(Sec. 1004) As an offset, this title reduces the authorization of appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities for FY2017.\n\nTITLE XI--VETERAN EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN SUPPORT ACT\n\nVeteran Emergency Medical Technician Support Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 1102) HHS must establish a demonstration program for states with a shortage of emergency medical technicians (EMTs) to streamline state requirements and procedures to assist veterans who completed military EMT training to meet state EMT certification, licensure, and other requirements.\n\nTITLE XII--JOHN THOMAS DECKER ACT\n\nJohn Thomas Decker Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 1202) HHS must report on the availability of information regarding prescription of opioids after youth sports injury, including information on opioid use and misuse, injury treatments that do not involve opioids, and treatment for opioid addiction. The report must determine the extent this information is available to teenagers and adolescents who play youth sports, their families, youth sports groups, and health care providers.\n\nTaking into consideration the findings of the report, HHS must develop and disseminate such information.\n\nTITLE XIII--LALI'S LAW\n\nLali's Law\n\n(Sec. 1302) HHS may make grants to states that allow standing orders (documents that allow a person to acquire, dispense, or administer a prescription medication without a person-specific prescription) for opioid overdose reversal drugs (e.g., naloxone). Grants may be used for:\n\n developing standing orders for opioid overdose reversal drugs for pharmacies, encouraging pharmacies to dispense drugs pursuant to such a standing order, implementing best practices for prescribing opioids and prescribing and discussing with patients opioid overdose reversal drugs, developing training for prescribers to use in educating the public on administration of opioid overdose reversal drugs, and educating the public on the availability and public health benefits of opioid overdose reversal drugs. States must report on pharmacies that dispense opioid overdose reversal drugs under a standing order and the number of pharmacists trained in educating the public on administration of opioid overdose reversal drugs.\n\n(Sec. 1303) As an offset, this title reduces the authorization of appropriations for Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities for FY2017.\n\nTITLE XIV--REDUCING UNUSED MEDICATIONS ACT\n\nReducing Unused Medications Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 1402) This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to allow a pharmacist to partially fill a prescription for a schedule II controlled substance (such as an opioid) if: (1) such partial fills are not prohibited by state law, (2) a partial fill is requested by the patient or prescribing practitioner, and (3) the total quantity dispensed in partial fillings does not exceed the quantity prescribed. Such prescriptions may also be partially filled in accordance with existing Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) regulations that permit partial fills when a pharmacist cannot supply a full quantity, a patient resides in a long-term care facility, or a patient is terminally ill.\n\nThe bill specifies time limits for filling the remaining portion of a partially filled prescription.\n\nTITLE XV--OPIOID REVIEW MODERNIZATION ACT\n\nOpioid Review Modernization Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 1502) This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to refer new drug applications for opioids to an advisory committee before approval, unless the FDA finds that such a referral is scientifically unnecessary and not in the interest of protecting and promoting public health and the FDA notifies Congress of its rationale.\n\nThe FDA must convene an advisory committee on labeling opioids for pediatric use before approving any such labeling.\n\n(Sec. 1503) As part of its evaluation of the Extended-Release/Long-Acting Opioid Analgesics Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, the FDA must develop recommendations regarding education programs for prescribers of opioids.\n\n(Sec. 1504) The FDA must finalize the draft guidance entitled \"General Principals for Evaluating the Abuse Deterrence of Generic Solid Oral Opioid Drug Products.\"\n\nTITLE XVI--EXAMINING OPIOID TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE ACT\n\nExamining Opioid Treatment Infrastructure Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 1602) The GAO must report on inpatient and outpatient treatment capacity, availability, and needs, including detoxification programs, clinical stabilization programs, transitional residential support services, rehabilitation programs, treatment programs for pregnant women or adolescents, and treatment through Indian health programs. The report must include the barriers to real-time reporting of drug overdoses at the federal, state, and local level and ways to overcome those barriers.\n\nTITLE XVII--OPIOID USE DISORDER TREATMENT EXPANSION AND MODERNIZATION ACT\n\nOpioid Use Disorder Treatment Expansion and Modernization Act\n\n (Sec. 1703) This bill revises the qualifications required for a practitioner to administer, dispense, or prescribe narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an office-based opioid treatment program.\n\nThe bill expands qualifying practitioners to include licensed nurse practitioners and physician assistants who have expertise and prescribe medications for opioid use disorder in collaboration with or under the supervision of a qualifying physician if state law requires physician oversight of prescribing authority. Qualifying practitioners must comply with reporting requirements and have the capacity to provide all FDA-approved drugs for opioid use disorder.\n\n HHS may change the maximum patient limit for qualifying practitioners. If HHS increases the limit, then a qualifying practitioner must obtain written consent from each patient regarding assessment and treatment.\n\nHHS must update the treatment improvement protocol containing best practice guidelines for the treatment of opioid-dependent patients in office-based settings.\n\nHHS may recommend revoking or suspending the registration of a practitioner who fails to comply with the requirements of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n(Sec. 1705) This section repeats section 1402.\n\nTITLE XVIII--NATIONAL ALL SCHEDULES PRESCRIPTION ELECTRONIC REPORTING REAUTHORIZATION ACT\n\nNational All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Reauthorization Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 1802) This bill amends the National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting Act of 2005 to include as a purpose of state prescription drug monitoring systems ensuring access to prescription history information for the investigative purposes of law enforcement, regulatory, and state professional licensing authorities.\n\n (Sec. 1803) The grant program for state prescription drug monitoring programs is extended through FY2020 and revised, including to:\n\n allow grants to be used to maintain and operate existing state prescription drug monitoring programs, require HHS to redistribute any returned funds among the remaining grantees, require a state to provide HHS with aggregate data and other information to enable HHS to evaluate the success of the state's program, and expand the program to include any commonwealth or territory of the United States. The DEA, HHS, a state Medicaid program, a state health department, or a state substance abuse agency receiving nonidentifiable information from a prescription drug monitoring database for research purposes may make that information available to other entities for research purposes.\n\nA state receiving a grant must: (1) facilitate prescriber and dispenser use of the state's prescription drug monitoring system, and (2) educate prescribers and dispensers on the benefits of the system both to them and society."
