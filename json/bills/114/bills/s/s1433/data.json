    "text": "Improving Driver Safety Act of 2015\n\nThis bill adds a new requirement for distracted driving grants to states under national priority highway safety programs. To receive a grant a state's prohibition on texting while driving must:\n\n include distracted driving issues as part of their driver's license examination, and not make an exception that specifically allows a driver, especially one under age 18, to text through a personal wireless communication device while stopped in traffic. DOT may use up to 50% of amounts available for grants to states that:\n\n in FY2016 certify that they have enacted a basic text messaging statute for drivers of all ages, make violation of the statute a primary offense, participate in the annual distracted driving law enforcement mobilization, and are otherwise ineligible for a grant; and in FY2017 meet the aforementioned requirements, impose increased fines for repeat violations, and have a statute that prohibits a driver younger than 18 from using a personal wireless communications device while driving. States may use grant funds for:\n\n enforcement of distracted driving laws, and highway safety program projects. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shall report to Congress on any legal and technical barriers to capturing data on the prevalence of the use of wireless communications devices while driving, including recommendations on how to address those barriers."
