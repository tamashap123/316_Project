Such study shall determine:\n\n the technical validity of such proposed requirements for reducing the risk of ROV off-road rollovers, the number of ROV rollovers that would be prevented if the proposed requirements were adopted, whether there is a technical basis for the proposal to provide information on a point-of-sale hangtag about a vehicle's rollover resistance on a progressive scale, and the effect on the utility of ROVs used by the Armed Forces if the proposed requirements were adopted. The CPSC must consider the results of the study in any subsequent rulemaking regarding the performance or configuration of ROVs or the provision of point-of-sale information regarding ROV performance.\n\nIf the CPSC is unable to enter into an acceptable agreement for the study with NAS within a specified time frame, it shall seek to enter into such agreement with another appropriate organization that is not part of the government, that operates as a not-for-profit entity, and that has expertise and objectivity comparable to NAS."
