For a sponsor to be eligible to rely upon submitted information: (1) the sponsor must have developed, or have a right of reference to, the relied upon information; and (2) the new medication must use nucleic acids (e.g., DNA) or similar chemicals, or must affect a disease-causing product of a mutated gene (e.g., the protein that causes cystic fibrosis)."
