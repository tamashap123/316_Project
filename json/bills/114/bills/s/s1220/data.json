DOE must: (1) lead an interagency effort to improve and coordinate data collection and analytical and modeling capabilities for energy distribution on shared energy infrastructure; and (2) coordinate the training of, and enhanced dialogue among, technical staff in federal agencies responsible for cross-border energy projects evaluation and implementation.\n\n The Energy Information Administration must collaborate with officials in Canada and Mexico to improve:\n\n the quality and transparency of North American energy data through reconciliation of data on energy trade flows among the U.S., Canada, and Mexico; the extension of energy mapping capabilities in those countries; and the development of common energy data terminology among the three nations."
