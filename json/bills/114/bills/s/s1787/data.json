    "text": "Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a full-service community schools grant program. A \u201cfull-service community school\u201d is a public elementary or secondary school that participates in a community-based effort to coordinate, integrate, and provide year-round access to educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services for students, families, and the community.\n\nED must require each grant recipient to provide matching funds based on a sliding scale that accounts for the grantee\u2019s ability to obtain matching funds and the relative poverty of the grantee\u2019s targeted population. However, ED may not consider an applicant\u2019s ability to match funds when determining which applicants will be awarded grants under the program. The duration of each renewable grant is five years.\n\nWith respect to program guidance, the bill also establishes principles of effectiveness as well as a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee."
