    "text": "(Although this measure has not been amended since it was passed by the Senate, the text was changed by H. Con. Res. 47 which made enrollment corrections, and the summary has been modified as necessary.)\n\nJustice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015\n\n TITLE I--JUSTICE FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING\n\n(Sec. 101) This section amends the federal criminal code to impose an additional assessment until the end of FY2019 of $5,000 on any non-indigent person or entity convicted of an offense involving: (1) peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons; (2) sexual abuse; (3) sexual exploitation and other abuse of children; (4) transportation for illegal sexual activity; or (5) human smuggling in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act (exempting any individual involved in the smuggling of an alien who is the alien's spouse, parent, son, or daughter). An assessment is not payable, however, until the person being assessed has satisfied all outstanding court-ordered fines, orders of restitution, and any other obligation related to victim compensation.\n\nThis section also establishes the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund into which revenues from such assessments shall be deposited and used in in FY2016-FY2019 to award grants to states and localities to combat trafficking, provide protection and assistance for victims of trafficking, develop and implement child abuse investigation and prosecution programs, and provide services for victims of child pornography. None of the amounts in the Fund may be used to provide health care or medical items or services, except for medical items or services to victims of trafficking.\n\n(Sec. 102) This section amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 to allow U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are victims of severe forms of trafficking to obtain benefits and services available to such victims without obtaining official certification from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of their status as victims.\n\n(Sec. 103) This section amends the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 to replace the pilot program to establish residential treatment facilities for juveniles subjected to trafficking with a program of three-year renewable block grants administered by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to develop, improve, or expand domestic child human trafficking deterrence programs that assist law enforcement and other entities in rescuing and restoring the lives of trafficking victims, while investigating and prosecuting offenses involving child human trafficking. No entity shall be disqualified from receiving a grant on the grounds that it has only recently begun soliciting data on child human trafficking.\n\nGrant funds may be used for the establishment or enhancement of: (1) specialized training programs for law enforcement officers, first responders, health care and child welfare officials, juvenile justice personnel, prosecutors, and judicial personnel to identify victims and acts of child human trafficking and facilitate the rescue of child victims of human trafficking; (2) anti-trafficking law enforcement units and task forces to investigate child human trafficking offenses and to rescue victims; and (3) problem solving court programs for trafficking victims. Grant funds may also be used for activities of law enforcement agencies to find homeless and runaway youth.\n\nDOJ must enter into a contract with a nongovernmental organization with experience in child human trafficking issues to conduct periodic evaluations of the such block grants to determine their effectiveness.\n\nDOJ is authorized to use funds from the Domestic Trafficking Victims' Fund in each of FY2016-FY2020 to carry out the block grant program.\n\n(Sec. 104) This section expand the definition of \"child abuse\" under the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 to include human trafficking and the production of child pornography and authorizes grants to develop and implement specialized programs to identify and provide direct services to victims of child pornography.\n\n(Sec. 105) This section provides for the forfeiture of real or personal property that was involved in the commission of human trafficking crimes. (Currently, forfeiture is allowed if the property was used or intended to be used to commit such crimes.) DOJ must transfer assets that are forfeited to satisfy victim restitution orders arising from human trafficking crimes.\n\n(Sec. 106) This section expands DOJ authority to intercept wire, oral, or electronic communications to include investigations of offenses relating to peonage, involuntary servitude, forced labor, and trafficking.\n\n(Sec. 107) This section amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to classify severe forms of trafficking in persons as a part I violent crime for purposes of allocating grant funds among states under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program.\n\n(Sec. 108) This section provides for the prosecution of individuals who patronize or solicit persons for a commercial sex act, thus making traffickers and buyers equally culpable for sex trafficking offenses.\n\n(Sec. 109) This section expresses the sense of Congress with respect to the criminal liability of buyers of commercial sex acts in sex trafficking prosecutions.\n\n(Sec. 110) This section requires DOJ to ensure that: (1) all task forces and working groups within the Innocence Lost National Initiative engage in activities, programs, or operations to increase the investigative capabilities of state and local law enforcement officers in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting persons who patronize or solicit children for sex; and (2) all components and task forces with jurisdiction to detect, investigate, and prosecute cases of child labor trafficking engage in activities, programs, or operations to increase the capacity of such components to deter and punish child labor trafficking.\n\n(Sec. 111) This section classifies producers of child pornography as traffickers engaged in illicit sexual conduct.\n\nThe evidentiary burden on the defense, in prosecutions for transporting minors to engage in illicit sexual conduct, to show that an accused reasonably believed that the minor had attained the age of 18 years is increased from a preponderance of the evidence to clear and convincing evidence.\n\n(Sec. 112) This section classifies crimes involving peonage, slavery, and trafficking in persons as crimes of violence under the federal criminal code.\n\n(Sec. 113) This section expands crime victims' rights by requiring notice of the right: (1) to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain or deferred prosecution agreement, and (2) to be informed of rights and services described in the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and contact information for the Office of the DOJ Victims' Rights Ombudsman. Appellate courts must apply ordinary standards of appellate review in reviewing appeals filed by crime victims.\n\nCombat Human Trafficking Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 114) This section requires DOJ to ensure that each DOJ anti-human trafficking program includes technical training on: (1) effective methods for investigating and prosecuting persons who obtain, patronize, or solicit commercial sex acts involving a person subject to severe forms of trafficking in persons (buyers); and (2) facilitating the provision of physical and mental health services to persons subject to severe forms of trafficking in persons. The Bureau of Justice Statistics of DOJ is required to prepare and submit annual reports on state enforcement of human trafficking prohibitions.\n\nSurvivors of Human Trafficking Empowerment Act\n\n(Sec. 115) This section establishes the United States Advisory Council on Human Trafficking to provide advice and recommendations to the Senior Policy Operating Group established under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 and the President's Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking. The Advisory Council terminates on September 30, 2020.\n\nBringing Missing Children Home Act\n\n(Sec. 116) This section amends the Crime Control Act of 1990 to: (1) require state reports on missing children to include a recent photograph of the missing child (if available), (2) reduce from 60 days to 30 days the period for verifying and updating records on missing children in a state law enforcement system and in National Crime Information Center computer networks, (3) require notification to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of each report received of a child reported missing from a foster care family home or childcare institution, and (4) grant permission to the National Crime Information Center Terminal Contractor to update the missing person record in the National Crime Information Center computer networks with additional information obtained from missing person investigations.\n\n(Sec. 117) This section requires the DOJ Inspector General to conduct annual audits of grant recipients under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2005 to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of funds. DOJ is prohibited from awarding a grant to a nonprofit organization that holds money in offshore accounts for tax avoidance purposes.\n\nThe bill imposes restrictions and reporting requirements on DOJ conferences that use more than $20,000 in DOJ funds and prohibits grant recipients from lobbying any representative of DOJ or a state, local, or tribal government regarding the award of grant funding.\n\nStop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2015 or the SAVE Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 118) This bill amends the federal criminal code to prohibit knowingly: (1) advertising commercial sex acts involving a minor or an individual engaged in such an act through force, fraud, or coercion; or (2) benefitting financially or otherwise from such advertising knowing that the individual involved was a minor or victim of force, fraud, or coercion.\n\n(Sec. 119) DOJ must make available on the website of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention a database for trafficking victim advocates, crisis hotline personnel, foster parents, law enforcement personnel, and crime survivors that contains information on counseling and hotline resources, housing resources, legal assistance, and other services for trafficking survivors.
