The FDA must withdraw approval for any indication for which the FDA determines there is insufficient evidence that the drug meets the criteria.\n\nThis bill expresses the sense of the Senate that a veterinarian-client-patient relationship should ensure that medically important antimicrobials are used in food-producing animals in a manner consistent with best practices."
