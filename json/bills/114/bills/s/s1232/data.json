The Smart Grid Regional Demonstration Initiative shall identify best practices for the implementation of the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPPS) of the Federal Trade Commission for the collection, use, disclosure, and retention of individual customer information.\n\nWhen selecting smart grid demonstration projects to receive assistance, DOE shall ensure: (1) geographical diversity, and (2) diversity among types of electricity markets and regulatory environments.\n\nAdditionally, DOE must make grants, on a competitive basis, for demonstration projects in any of seven designated program areas, including:\n\n transactive energy, innovation in valuation of new technology grid services and efficiency, rate design-distribution system, and rate design-consumer acceptance of time-based pricing. As a prerequisite for financial assistance, a participant in a smart grid demonstration project must provide information required by DOE, which shall become available through the smart grid information clearinghouse and for purposes of producing certain reports.\n\nDOE must also establish a working group composed of representatives of each project selected to receive assistance within a program area."
