(An IHE's net price is the average yearly price actually charged to first-time, full-time undergraduate students receiving student aid at the school after deducting such aid.)\n\n It authorizes the Department of Education to develop a universal net price calculator that enables users to answer one set of questions and receive net prices for any IHE that is required to have a net price calculator."
