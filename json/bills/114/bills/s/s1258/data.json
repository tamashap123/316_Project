DOE must establish: (1) a loan program to provide funding for deploying distributed energy systems to states and other government entities, institutions of higher education, and electric utilities; and (2) a technical assistance and grant program to disseminate information and provide technical assistance to nonprofit and profit entities for identifying, evaluating, planning, and designing distributed energy systems."
