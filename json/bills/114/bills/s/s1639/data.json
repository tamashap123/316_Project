    "text": "Education Stability for Foster Youth Act\n\nThis bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require a state plan for academic content and achievement standards to describe how the state will ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. Specifically, a state plan must include assurances that: (1) a foster child will remain or be enrolled in the child\u2019s school of origin absent a determination that such enrollment is not in the child\u2019s best interest; (2) if such a determination is made, the child will be immediately enrolled in a new school, which must immediately contact the child\u2019s previous school to obtain relevant records; and (3) the state will designate a point of contact for child welfare agencies, who shall also oversee implementation of the state\u2019s responsibilities under the bill.\n\nRelatedly, a local educational agency (LEA) plan must provide assurances that the LEA will develop and implement procedures governing the provision and funding of transportation services necessary to maintain a foster child\u2019s enrollment in the child\u2019s school of origin.\n\nThis bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to alter the definition of \u201chomeless children and youths\u201d to no longer include children who are awaiting foster care placement."
