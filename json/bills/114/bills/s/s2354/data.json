Executive agencies may not obligate more than 90% of the amount they obligated in FY2010 to purchase or lease civilian vehicles in each of FY2016-FY2020.\n\nThe bill permanently rescinds all unobligated amounts in the U.S. Enrichment Corporation Fund, except for amounts designated as an emergency requirement."
