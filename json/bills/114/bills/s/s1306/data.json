In carrying out the study, DOE must:\n\n solicit industry and stakeholder input; evaluate the effectiveness of the advanced fossil loan guarantee incentive program in advancing carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology; review each incentive provided by federal agencies for CCS demonstration projects to determine the adequacy and effectiveness of the combined federal incentives in advancing CCS and advanced fossil energy technologies; assess whether combinations of existing incentive programs could be effective to advance CCS and advanced fossil energy technologies; and evaluate the impact of implementing the recommendations described in the January 2015 National Coal Council report entitled, \"Fossil Forward: Revitalizing CCS, Bringing Scale and Speed to CCS Deployment,\" on the effectiveness of the advanced fossil loan guarantee program."
