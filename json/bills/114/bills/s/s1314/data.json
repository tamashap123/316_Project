A drone may not be operated until the operator of a test site certifies that it meets the requirements in the rulemaking notice and can operate within the restrictions.\n\nThe owner or operator of a drone involved in an accident causing personal injury or property damage must report it to the FAA within two days after the accident.\n\nThe FAA shall:\n\n appoint a Deputy Associate Administrator for Unmanned Aircraft, establish a joint aircraft system research and development data collection and analysis program at the William J. Hughes Technical Center, and implement an air traffic management pilot program to research and test a new regulatory structure for drone operations in airspace below 1,200 feet."
