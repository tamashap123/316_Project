    "text": "Imported Seafood Safety Standards Act\n\nAmends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the importation of any seafood from a foreign country unless the country complies with U.S. standards for seafood manufacturing, processing, and holding. Requires an annual inspection of each foreign facility that exports seafood to the United States to ensure compliance with U.S. standards. Requires periodic follow-up inspections of foreign facilities as determined necessary by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n\nRequires the FDA to inspect and test not less than 20% of all imported seafood each year and the first 15 shipments of seafood imported from a new exporter. Sets forth procedures in the event an exporter fails to meet inspection or test requirements.\n\nDirects the FDA to refuse entry of all seafood shipments from a country that repeatedly fails to meet inspection or testing requirements and establish exporter fees as necessary.\n\nRequires the detention or destruction of imported seafood that fails to meet safety standards unless the shipment meets criteria for re-export.\n\nAllows importation of seafood at only those U.S. ports of entry that have the personnel trained to conduct the applicable testing and inspections.\n\nProhibits making a knowingly false statement with respect to a test or inspection under this Act or knowingly misbranding any seafood imported under this Act. Establishes a civil penalty for violations.\n\nAuthorizes the FDA to establish a program under which a state may conduct inspection, testing, and certification of U.S. seafood imports."
