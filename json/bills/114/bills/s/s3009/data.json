The President shall report semiannually to specified congressional committees on the number of loans, and their dollar amount, made under the Military Reservist Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, including the subsidy rate of those loans.\n\n(Sec. 3) The SBA shall to make grants and enter into contracts and cooperative agreements with specified public and private entities for outreach programs for the spouses of veterans and members of a reserve component of the armed forces.\n\n In making such grants the SBA shall establish a National Guard and Reserve Deployment Support and Business Training Program to give training, counseling and other assistance to support members of a reserve component of the armed forces and their spouses.\n\nIn establishing this program the SBA may:\n\n modify existing programs and resources to disseminate pre-deployment and other information specific to members of a reserve component of the Armed Forces and their spouses; collaborate with the National Guard Bureau (NGB), State Adjunct Generals (or their designees), and other public and private partners; and furnish training, information, and other resources to the NGB and State Adjunct Generals (or designees) to support members of a reserve component of the armed forces, their spouses, and the spouses of veterans."
