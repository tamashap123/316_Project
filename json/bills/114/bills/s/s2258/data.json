DOT shall also determine the team to carry out an audit, which shall include at least one member the state designates (who may have relevant expertise and experience and not be an employee of either the state or DOT).\n\n In cooperation with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, DOT shall carry out education, training, peer exchange, and other initiatives to:\n\n assist states in developing the capacity to participate in the assignment program, and promote information sharing and collaboration among states participating in the program."
