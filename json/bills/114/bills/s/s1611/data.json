(Sec. 710) The Howard Coble Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 is amended with respect to the allowance of parking spaces at the DHS St. Elizabeths Campus to Coast Guard members or employees to require that parking be at no cost to the Coast Guard, its members, or employees. (Sec. 711) The Coast Guard shall: assess the effectiveness of oil spill response activities specific to the Great Lakes, and report to Congress on the status of technology for immediately detecting cruise ship passengers who have fallen overboard TITLE VIII--VESSEL INCIDENTAL DISCHARGE ACT Vessel Incidental Discharge Act\n\n(Sec. 804) The Coast Guard shall establish and implement enforceable uniform national standards for the regulation of discharges into navigable waters incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.\n\n(Sec. 805) The Coast Guard's 2012 rule for ballast water discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel are adopted until those performance standards are revised or a more stringent state standard is adopted. Ballast water is water taken aboard a vessel to control stability or during the operation of a vessel's ballast water treatment technology.\n\nWithin two years, the Coast Guard must establish best management practices for discharges other than ballast water which are also incidental to the normal operation of a vessel.\n\nBy January 1, 2020, the Coast Guard must complete a feasibility review to determine whether revising ballast water performance standards will result in a scientifically demonstrable and substantial reduction in the risk of introduction or establishment of aquatic nuisance species. By January 1, 2022, the Coast Guard must establish a revised standard based on the ballast water treatment technology available. Further revisions to the performance standards shall be considered every 10 years.\n\n(Sec. 806) This bill establishes a certification requirement for ballast water treatment technology. The Department in which the Coast Guard is operating may not approve a technology if it uses a biocide or generates a biocide that is a pesticide.\n\n(Sec. 807) The bill permanently exempts certain vessels from permit requirements for those discharges, including fishing vessels, recreational vessels, or vessels that are less than 79 feet and engaged in commercial service.\n\n(Sec. 808) The Department may establish one or more compliance programs as an alternative to ballast water management regulations issued under this Act for a vessel that:\n\n has a maximum ballast water capacity of less than 8 cubic meters, is less than 3 years from the end of the useful life of the vessel, or discharges ballast water into a facility for the reception of ballast water that meets certain standards. (Sec. 809) Interested persons may petition within 120 days for review of a final regulation promulgated under this title in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n(Sec. 810) This bill also establishes a petition process for a state seeking to enforce a state or local statute or regulation related to ballast water discharges more stringent than federal performance standards.\n\n(Sec. 811) This title is declared the exclusive statutory authority for federal regulation of discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel to which this title applies."
