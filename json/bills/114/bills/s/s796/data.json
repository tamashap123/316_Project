    "text": "Investing in States to Achieve Tuition Equality for Dreamers Act of 2015 or the IN-STATE for Dreamers Act of 2015\n\nAmends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to direct the Secretary of Education to allot grants to states to offer Dreamer students in-state tuition and expand their access to in-state financial aid.\n\nDefines a \"Dreamer student\" as an individual who:\n\n was under age 16 upon entering this country; has provided a list of each secondary school the individual attended in this country; and has earned a high school diploma or certain similar credentials, or is scheduled to complete the requirements for such a credential before the next academic year begins; has acquired a degree from an institution of higher education (IHE) or has successfully completed at least 2 years of a program for a baccalaureate or higher degree in the United States and has made satisfactory academic progress; is a beneficiary of the Deferrred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; or has served honorably in the uniformed services for at least 4 years. Directs the Secretary to provide for a hardship exception to either or both of the first two of such requirements.\n\nRequires grant applicants to assure the Secretary that they: (1) will not discriminate against Dreamer students in awarding student aid or determining who is eligible for in-state tuition, if the student would otherwise be eligible for in-state financial aid as a state resident; and (2) will maintain, through FY 2025, at least their FY2013 level of support for their public IHEs, as adjusted for inflation.\n\nAllots grants to each state based on its proportion of resident Dreamer students who are enrolled at least half-time in postsecondary education.\n\nAmends the Immigration and Nationality Act to direct the Secretary of Homeland Security to collect a specified fee from recipients of F-1 visas, provided to nonimmigrant full-time students.\n\nEliminates the prohibition on states offering unlawful aliens postsecondary benefits on the basis of their residence in the state that are more generous than those offered citizens or naturals of this country, without regard to their state residence.\n\nAllows individuals who have served honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces to be naturalized without having been lawfully admitted to this country for permanent residence."
