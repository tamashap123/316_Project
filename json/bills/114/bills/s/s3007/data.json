Certification is required for each sensor and platform for which the Russian Federation has requested approval under the treaty.\n\nThe President may waive the requirement of Russian compliance with treaty obligations by certifying that sensor certification or approval is in U.S. national security interests. Such certification must include the date such compliance is expected and a description of U.S. efforts to achieve it.\n\n\"Covered state party\" means a foreign country that is a state party to the treaty and a U.S. ally."
