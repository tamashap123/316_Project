(A tribal healing to wellness court is a drug court that is a component of a tribal justice system and includes substance abuse treatment and may include cultural activities.)\n\nCourts receiving grants must monitor individuals under their jurisdiction and must periodically test each individual for drug use. DOJ may require these courts to increase punitive or treatment responses for an individual who fails a drug test.\n\nViolent offenders may not be under the jurisdiction of these courts unless the court has received a waiver from DOJ."
