The summary has been expanded because action occurred on the measure.)\n\nSmall Business Innovation Protection Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 4) This bill directs the Small Business Administration to develop partnership agreements that arrange for:\n\n development of high-quality training for small businesses related to domestic and international protection of intellectual property, leveraging of training materials already developed for the education of inventors and small businesses, and participation of a nongovernmental organization. These agreements must also arrange for training:\n\n through electronic resources, including Internet-based webinars, and at physical locations, including a small business development center; and the headquarters or a regional office of the United States Patent and Trade Office. (Sec. 5) The bill amends the Small Business Act to require services at a small business development center to include training in person or through a website relating to:\n\n domestic and international intellectual property protections, and how those protections should be considered in the business plans and growth strategies of small businesses."
