    "text": "Food Labeling Modernization Act of 2015\n\nThis bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to require the front of food packages to bear a nutrition label that complies with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations. The bill specifies principles for such regulations, including that there should be a standard, easily understood symbol system for calorie and nutrient information.\n\nOnly under specified conditions may the front of a food package include: (1) descriptions of whole grain content, (2) the term \"wheat\" or \"whole wheat,\" or (3) a reference to a characterizing ingredient.\n\nIf a food contains added coloring, non-caloric sweetener, or flavoring, that fact must be stated on the front of the package.\n\nThe FDA must regulate food labels that make claims about the mechanism by which a nutrient affects the body. Food manufacturers must substantiate health claims on a label upon request from the FDA. Labeling regarding trans fat and cholesterol is restricted. The FDA must establish a level of added sugars above which a food is disqualified from making health claims on the label.\n\nRegarding food labels, the FDA must: (1) regulate use of \"natural,\" (2) prohibit use of \"healthy\" on certain foods, and (3) establish formatting requirements for ingredient lists.\n\nFood labels must include the percent of recommended daily calories and daily added sugars per serving. Labels must disclose the amount of added sugars in teaspoons and grams.\n\nFoods containing caffeine must be labeled with the amount.\n\nSesame is added to the list of major food allergens.\n\nThe names of major food allergens in nonpackaged food offered for sale at retail must be on a sign adjacent to the food.\n\nFood manufacturers and importers must submit to the FDA for publication the information to be included on a food's label and keep this information updated.\n\n\"Artificial\" and \"synthetic\" are defined for purposes of the FFDCA."
