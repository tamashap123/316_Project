A sanctuary city shall be eligible to receive such funds after the Attorney General certifies that it is no longer a sanctuary city.\n\nThe Attorney General shall prioritize a request from the Secretary of Homeland Security to transfer an alien who is without lawful status in the United States and in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody before a request from a state or state subdivision to transfer the covered alien to its custody."
