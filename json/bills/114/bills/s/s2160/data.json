(Such enlistees need not establish that they entered the United States prior to January 1, 1972, or comply with other specified requirements.)\n\nDirects DHS to rescind such adjusted status if the person is separated from the armed forces under other than honorable conditions before the person served for a period or periods aggregating five years.\n\nDeems any person who has received an award from the U.S. Armed Forces for engagement in active combat or active participation in combat to have satisfied specified naturalization requirements."
