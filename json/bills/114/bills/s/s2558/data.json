Existing caller identification requirements that apply to calls made using a telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service are revised to apply to voice communications using resources from the North American Numbering Plan.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) must publish on its website a report that identifies existing technologies that consumers can use to protect against misleading or inaccurate caller identification information.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office must report on: (1) actions taken, or actions that could be taken, by the FCC or the Federal Trade Commission to combat the fraudulent provision of misleading or inaccurate caller identification information; and (2) any recommendations to combat the fraudulent provision of such information."
