The Secretary, for such analysis, must consider and examine:\n\n technology needs and challenges; personnel needs and challenges; the role of state, tribal, and local law enforcement in general border security activities; the need for cooperation among federal, state, tribal, local, and Canadian law enforcement entities relating to border security; and the geographic challenges of the northern border."
