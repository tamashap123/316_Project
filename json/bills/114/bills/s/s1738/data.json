    "text": "Safer Communities Act of 2015\n\nThis bill provides grants to expand mental health crisis assistance programs, to support comprehensive school mental health programs, and to enhance mental health and substance abuse needs of prison inmates.\n\nThe bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to expand research on violence associated with mental illness and substance abuse disorders.\n\nIt requires the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand the National Violent Death Reporting System to all 50 states and to research the causes, mechanisms, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries from gun violence.\n\nThe bill states that no provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act prohibits physicians from asking patients about guns in their homes, speaking to a patient about gun safety, or reporting a patient's threat of violence.\n\nIt amends the Gun Control Act of 1968 to specify that the term \"committed to a mental institution\" applies to involuntary inpatient or outpatient treatment.\n\nThe bill amends the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to permit the Department of Justice (DOJ) to award grants to states to remove firearms from individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others.\n\nDOJ must promptly notify law enforcement agencies when a prohibited person attempts to purchase a firearm.\n\nThe bill replaces statutory references to persons \"adjudicated as a mental defective\" with persons \"adjudicated as ineligible due to disqualifying mental status.\"\n\nIt amends the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 to:\n\n establish procedures to restore firearm ownership rights after a mental health adjudication or commitment, require an annual report on record submissions due to domestic violence misdemeanor convictions, authorize state grants to improve the automation and transmittal of mental health and criminal history records, and require quarterly updates to federal agency record submissions. The bill reauthorizes the National Criminal History Records Improvement Program for FY2016-FY2019."
