The Andean Trade Preference Act is amended to eliminate the U.S. International Trade Commission's reports regarding the economic impact of the President's authority to proclaim duty-free treatment to beneficiary countries and the effectiveness of drug-related crop eradication.\n\nThe bill eliminates a provision that required the President to report on compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act for projects under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009."
