Authorizes the President to: (1) provide defense articles, defense services, and related training directly to the KRG military and security services to support international coalition efforts against ISIL or any successor group; and (2) issue licenses authorizing U.S. exporters to export defense articles, defense services, and related training directly to the KRG military and security services.\n\n States that nothing in this Act shall be construed as establishing a precedent for the future provision of such assistance to organizations other than a country or international organization."
