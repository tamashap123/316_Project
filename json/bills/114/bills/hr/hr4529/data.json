The bill also revises the formula for determining that base.\n\nThe number of an individual's benefit computation years, for the purpose of determining the individual's primary OASDI insurance amount, shall be further reduced (after a specified initial reduction) by the number of the individual's childcare years (not exceeding five), except that not more than two years may be determined to be a childcare year on the basis of the individual's status as a primary caregiver for the same child.\n\n\"Childcare year\" means an elapsed year of the individual:\n\n during which the individual is the primary caregiver for a child under age 6, and for which the total of the individual's wages and self-employment income is $0."
