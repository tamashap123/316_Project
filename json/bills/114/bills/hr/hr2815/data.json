The Government Accountability Office must review the impact analysis for accuracy and completeness.\n\nED's impact analysis must include the effect of income- or employment-based metrics on all postsecondary education programs and students at all categories of institutions of higher education that participate in a title IV program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, the correlation between variables other than quality of education that could affect income and debt-to-income ratios or employment outcome, and the comparison of various income sources and debt data utilized under the regulation or performance framework.\n\nThe requirement established by this Act terminates when a law is enacted that reauthorizes the Higher Education Act of 1965 for at least two fiscal years."
