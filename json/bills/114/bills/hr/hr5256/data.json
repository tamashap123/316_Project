CBP shall increase the number of CBP officers by 1,000 and the number of CBP Agriculture Specialists by 300 for each of fiscal years 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to establish within CBP the Immigration Cooperation Program, under which CBP, pursuant to an arrangement with a foreign country, may cooperate with foreign authorities, air carriers, and security employees at foreign airports to identify persons who may be inadmissible to the United States or otherwise pose a risk to U.S. security.\n\nThe Government Accountability Office shall review and report on the adequacy and appropriateness of the security screening process for each U.S. nonimmigrant visa category."
