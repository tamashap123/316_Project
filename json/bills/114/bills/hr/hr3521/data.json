In awarding grants, the Office must seek to improve stock assessments through innovative approaches to data collection that incorporates data from peer-reviewed research involving academia, fishermen, and other fisheries sources.\n\nThe Department of Commerce must: (1) seek to improve communications by the National Marine Fisheries Service with stakeholders regarding the reef fish species stock assessment processes and outcomes of those processes, and (2) develop a process for using data collected through cooperative research activities for those stock assessments."
