An administrative contractor that performs such payment-related functions shall implement a contractor-wide information security program.\n\nThe VA shall use claims payment error rates or similar methodology of administrative contractors in the processing or reviewing of claims in order to give such contractors an incentive to implement effective education and outreach programs for non-VA facilities."
