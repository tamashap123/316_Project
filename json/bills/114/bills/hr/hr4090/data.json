HHS must establish a procedure under which an individual otherwise entitled to benefits under part A (Hospital Insurance) of title XVIII (Medicare) of the SSAct may waive such entitlement and be automatically enrolled in the MAV Program.\n\nIn addition, the bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to increase the amount of the deduction from gross income for health savings accounts by the amount of the MAV that is contributed to an individual's health savings account.\n\nThe bill also suspends Medicare late enrollment penalties for an individual between ages 65 and 70."
