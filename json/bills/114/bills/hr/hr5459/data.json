    "text": "Cyber Preparedness Act of 2016\n\nThis bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to expand the responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS's) State, Local, and Regional Fusion Center Initiative to include serving as a point of contact to ensure the dissemination of cybersecurity risk information within the scope of its information sharing environment with state, local, and regional fusion centers. (A fusion center serves as a focal point within the state and local environment for the receipt, analysis, gathering, and sharing of threat-related information between the federal government and state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners.)\n\nFusion center officers or intelligence analysts must assist law enforcement agencies and emergency response providers in using such cybersecurity risk information.\n\nDHS's national cybersecurity and communications integration center may include, and must share analysis and best practices with, state and major urban area fusion centers.\n\nStates, local or tribal governments, or high-risk urban areas receiving grants to protect against terrorism under the Urban Area Security Initiative or the State Homeland Security Grant Program may use the funds to prepare for and respond to cybersecurity risks and incidents.\n\nThe bill expresses the sense of Congress that DHS should share actionable information related to cyber threats in an unclassified form to facilitate the timely dissemination to state, local, and private sector stakeholders."
