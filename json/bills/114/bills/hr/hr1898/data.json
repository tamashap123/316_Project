Expands the Program to include undergraduate education programs in science and engineering education, expanded research and development initiatives, and nanomanufacturing research.\n\nEngineering Biology Research and Development Act of 2015\n\nDirects the President to: (1) implement a National Engineering Biology Research and Development Program to advance societal well-being, national security, and economic productivity and competitiveness; and (2) designate an advisory committee on engineering biology research and development.\n\nSTEM Opportunities Act of 2015\n\nRequires the OSTP to develop consistent federal policies for recipients of federal research awards who have caregiving responsibilities, including care for a newborn or newly adopted child, and consistent federal guidance to grant reviewers and program officers on best practices to minimize the effects of implicit bias based on gender, race, or ethnicity in the review of federal research grants.\n\nRequires the NSF to: (1) collect demographic data of STEM faculty and develop and disseminate guidance to universities to identify cultural and institutional barriers limiting the recruitment, retention, and achievement of women and minorities in research careers; and (2) award grants to institutions of higher educations to increase the recruitment, retention, and advancement of individuals from underrepresented minority groups in academic STEM careers.\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 2015\n\nAuthorizes appropriations for FY2016-FY2020 for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) for: (1) scientific and technical research and services laboratory activities; (2) facilities construction and maintenance; and (3) industrial technology services activities.\n\nDepartment of Energy Office of Science Authorization Act of 2015\n\nSets forth the mission of the DOE Office of Science as the delivery of scientific discoveries, capabilities, and major scientific tools to transform the understanding of nature and to advance the energy, economic, and national security of the United States.\n\nEstablishes programs in the Office for basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research, advanced scientific computing research, fusion energy research, physics and nuclear physics research, and improvement of the infrastructure at Office of Science laboratories. ARPA-E Reauthorization Act of 2015\n\nDirects DOE to make five-year (renewable) awards to consortia for establishing and operating Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support, whenever practicable at one centralized location, multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, and demonstration of advanced energy technologies.\n\nEstablishes in DOE the position of Under Secretary for Science and Energy and grants the Under Secretary special hiring authority for scientific, engineering, and personnel."
