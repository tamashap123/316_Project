A new or revised national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) may not apply to the review and disposition of a preconstruction permit application unless the EPA publishes implementation guidance with the NAAQS.\n\nThe EPA must submit annually a report on actions to expedite the process for review of preconstruction permits."
