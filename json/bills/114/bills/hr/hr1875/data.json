In determining an individual's eligibility to receive Compensation Fund benefits the Secretary shall accept as proof of service an affidavit from the government of the Philippines certifying an eligible individual's service (AGO Form 23).\n\n Such an affidavit shall serve as proof of service regardless of whether the eligible individual:\n\n submits any other qualifying document, or is included in the Approved Revised Reconstructed Guerilla Roster of 1948, (Missouri List). The Secretary may not accept such an affidavit as proof of service for any VA benefit other than the Compensation Fund.\n\nNothing in this Act shall be construed as authorizing additional amounts to be appropriated to the Compensation Fund."
