The expanded summary of the House reported version is repeated here.)\n\nGood Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016\n\n(Sec. 3) This bill requires the Government Accountability Office to submit a report about the Office of National Drug Control Policy's (ONDCP's) review of state and local Good Samaritan laws that exempt from criminal or civil liability any individual who administers an opioid overdose reversal drug or device or who contacts emergency services providers in response to an overdose. The report must: (1) address the extent to which the ONDCP has reviewed such Good Samaritan laws, including any findings related to the potential effects of such laws; (2) describe the ONDCP's efforts to encourage enactment of such laws; and (3) provide a compilation of such Good Samaritan laws in effect in states.\n\n(Sec. 4) For purposes of the report, \"opioid\" means any drug, including heroin, having an addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability similar to morphine or being capable of conversion into a drug having such addiction-forming or addiction-sustaining liability."
