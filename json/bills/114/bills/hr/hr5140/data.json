(Veterinary Feed Directive regulations prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics for animal production purposes. Under these regulations, an animal producer may only use such antibiotics with the authorization of a veterinarian for the prevention, control, or treatment of a specifically identified disease. The rule repealed by this bill revised those regulations, including to require a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship for a veterinarian to authorize the use of antibiotics.)"
