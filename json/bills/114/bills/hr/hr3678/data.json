(Drug manufacturers and importers pay an annual fee based on their sales of brand name prescription drugs, excluding sales of orphan drugs.) Currently, only medications for rare conditions for which a tax credit for clinical trials was allowed are considered orphan drugs.\n\nThis Act applies to fees paid after 2014."
