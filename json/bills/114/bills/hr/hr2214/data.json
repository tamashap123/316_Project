Expands from 10 to 15 the maximum number of VA regional offices through which the Secretary is authorized to carry out such pilot program.\n\nDirects the Secretary to conduct an annual data analysis (including an analysis of backlogged claims, pending workloads, and the timeliness of completed cases) to determine the regional offices requiring support."
