(Sec. 5) Within 30 days after enactment of this bill the TSA shall:\n\n utilize TSA Behavior Detection Officers for passenger and baggage security screening, including the verification of traveler documents, particularly at designated PreCheck lanes to ensure that they are operational for use and maximum efficiency; make every practicable effort to grant additional flexibility and authority to Federal Security Directors in matters related to checkpoint and checked baggage staffing allocation and employee overtime in furtherance of maintaining minimal passenger wait times and maximum security effectiveness; disseminate to aviation security stakeholders and appropriate TSA personnel a list of checkpoint optimization best practices; expand efforts to increase the public's participation in the TSA PreCheck program; and request the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to make recommendations on best practices for checkpoint operations optimization. By the same 30-day deadline the TSA shall direct each Federal Security Director to coordinate local representatives of aviation security stakeholders to establish a staffing advisory working group at each airport at which the TSA oversees or performs passenger security screening to give recommendations to TSA on Transportation Security Officer staffing numbers.\n\n(Sec. 6) The bill defines the term \"aviation security stakeholders\" to mean air carriers, airport operators, and labor organizations representing Transportation Security Officers or contract screeners."
