Defines an \"eligible employer\" as a small business concern or a major corporation that has an operation located in an enterprise zone or in an area in which the unemployment rate exceeds the national average unemployment rate by more than 2%.\n\nAllows college graduates who are participating in the program, either as grantees or beneficiaries of grants to their employers, to defer payment on their federal student loans under title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 until their participation in the program ends.\n\nRequires graduates who are awarded a program grant to be eligible to receive federal student aid under title IV without regard to whether they have been or are delinquent on title IV loans."
