(Sec. 6) The TSA may evaluate foreign countries' air cargo programs to determine whether they provide a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs. If so, the TSA shall approve and officially recognize such country's program, in which case such country shall not be required to adhere to the U.S. programs that would otherwise be applicable. The bill provides for revocation or temporary suspension of approval and official recognition if the TSA determines that a country's program no longer provides a level of security commensurate with that required by U.S. air cargo security programs.\n\n(Sec. 7) The TSA shall request the Aviation Security Advisory Committee to develop recommendations for more efficient and effective passenger screening processes. The Committee shall consider the following:\n\n the configuration of a checkpoint; technology innovation; ways to address any vulnerabilities identified in audits of checkpoint operations; ways to prevent security breaches at airports at which federal security screening is provided; best practices in aviation security; recommendations from airport and aircraft operators, and from any relevant advisory committees; and \"curb to curb\" processes and procedures."
