The Army Corps of Engineers shall make such public interest determination separately for each proposed project to be undertaken within the boundaries described, using reasonable discretion, within 150 days of the date of submission of appropriate plans for such project.\n\nThis bill's declaration shall apply only to those parts of the areas described that are or will be bulkheaded and filled or otherwise occupied by permanent structures, including marina and recreation facilities."
