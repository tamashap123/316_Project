Each agency shall submit biannually to OMB and to the Council a comprehensive plan that integrates consideration of extreme weather into its operations and overall mission objectives. OMB shall consolidate and submit such plans to Congress.\n\nAnnual agency performance plans shall include the most recent agency extreme weather plan."
