Requires DOD to verify that the clinical trial information has been submitted before releasing any remaining grant funds or funding future grants.\n\nMakes a clinical trial grantee of the Department of Health and Human Services or DOD who fails to submit the required information to the data bank ineligible for the remaining grant funds or future funds. Makes the grantee liable for repayment of grant amounts already provided."
