(The program enables ACOs to receive payments for savings stemming from care coordination and management.)\n\nSpecifically, the bill requires the basis for assignment to reflect beneficiaries' utilization of not only primary care services provided by ACO physicians, but also those furnished in federally qualified health centers or rural health clinics."
