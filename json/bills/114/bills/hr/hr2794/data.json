The office may award grants to states to form and operate State New American Councils to, among other activities: (1) develop, implement, or enhance plans to introduce new immigrants to a state; and (2) disseminate best practices pertaining to English acquisition and civics education.\n\nThe bill also establishes, as part of the general business credit, a tax credit for employer-provided adult English literacy and basic education programs. For the taxable year, the employer's credit is an amount equal to 20% of qualified education program expenses, or no more than $1,000 per full-time employee participating in the program.\n\nIn addition, the bill establishes the Presidential Award for Business Leadership in Promoting United States Citizenship to recognize businesses and other organizations, and a citizen award program to recognize naturalized citizens who have made an outstanding contribution to the United States."
