Calls upon the United States, in partnership with other international donors, to ensure that Burma and the Union Election Commission function independently and impartially throughout the election period.\n\nExpects the President to: (1) delay further steps toward normalization of relations with the government of Burma should it undermine the prospects for free and fair elections, and (2) sanction individuals in the government of Burma who the President determines undermine free and fair elections.\n\nCalls upon the Secretary to publicly condemn human rights abuses committed by the military and to demand credible and independent investigations and prosecutions of all allegations of such abuse."
