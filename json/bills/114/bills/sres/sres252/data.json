The period for rolling over gain from the sale of such stock without tax consequences is extended from 60 days to 1 year.\n\nTITLE IV--PROMOTION AND EXPANSION OF PRIVATE EMPLOYEE OWNERSHIP\n\nPromotion and Expansion of Private Employee Ownership Act of 2015\n\n(Sec. 403) This section extends to all domestic corporations, including S corporations, provisions allowing deferral of tax on the gain from the sale of employer securities to an S corporation-sponsored employer stock ownership plan (ESOP).\n\n(Sec. 404) This section directs Treasury to establish the S Corporation Employee Ownership Assistance Office to foster increased employee ownership of S corporations. The Office shall provide: (1) education and outreach to inform companies and individuals about the possibilities and benefits of employee ownership of S corporations, and (2) technical assistance to assist S corporations in sponsoring employee stock ownership plans\n\n(Sec. 405) This section amends the Small Business Act to define \"ESOP business concern\" and allow such a concern to continue to qualify for loans, preferences, and other programs under such Act."
