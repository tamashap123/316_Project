The summary of that version is repeated here.)\n\nDesignates April 2015 as National Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Awareness Month. (Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a birth defect that occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully form, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth.)\n\nEncourages that steps should be taken to:\n\n raise awareness of and increase public knowledge about congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH); inform all Americans about the dangers of CDH; disseminate information on the importance of quality neonatal care for CDH patients; promote quality prenatal care and the use of ultrasounds to detect CDH in utero; and support research funding of CDH to improve screening and treatment, discover its causes, and develop a cure."
