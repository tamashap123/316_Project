The President must submit an annual budget in which total outlays for operating funds do not exceed total receipts for those funds for the fiscal year.\n\nCongress may waive the requirements for two years if: (1) a declaration of war is in effect, or (2) the Congressional Budget Office estimates that real economic growth has been or will be less than 1% for two consecutive quarters during the two-year period.\n\nCongress may also waive the requirements for any year in which the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security."
