It includes funding for a comprehensive jobs bill and targeted investments to reduce the poverty in America. The CBC budget protects the social safety net without cutting Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or SNAP. It raises new revenue by making our tax system fairer, saving more than $1.9 trillion on the deficit over the next decade and reduces the annual budget deficit to 2.3% of GDP by FY 2025.",
